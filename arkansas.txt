Benchbook Disclaimer
Arkansas benchbooks are a resource for members of the judiciary. The books
attempt to take relevant statutes, court rules, case law, and forms for a particular
area and consolidate them into one document. The benchbooks do not carry any
legal authority and should not be cited in legal proceedings or documents.
Readers are encouraged to use the books as a quick reference to applicable law. To
ensure judges have an accurate reflection of the law, hyperlinks have been included
to direct the reader to relevant statutes, court rules, and case law.
Historically, the books are updated after every substantive legislative session so
that the judiciary is aware of changes in statutory provisions. When the books are
updated, new cases are highlighted that may be helpful to judges as they consider
issues. Each book includes the date it was last updated on the front cover.
Drafters of the benchbooks strive to report all information free from opinion or
commentary.Arkansas Circuit Courts

Age of Consent
Every male and every female who is at least eighteen (18) years of age shall be capable in
law of contracting marriage.
However, males and females who are seventeen (17) years of age may contract marriage if
they furnish the clerk with a verified affidavit signed in the presence of a notary public that
states that the parent, parents, or guardian consent to the marriage.
The consent of both parents of each contracting party shall be necessary before the
marriage license can be issued by the clerk unless:
the parents have been divorced and custody of the child has been awarded to one
(1) of the parents exclusive of the other, or
unless the custody of the child has been surrendered by one (1) of the parents
through abandonment or desertion, in which cases the consent of the parent who
has custody of the child shall be sufficient, or
a guardian has been appointed for the child, in which case the consent of the
guardian is sufficient.
The consent of the parent or guardian may be voided by the order of a circuit court on a
showing by clear and convincing evidence that: (i) The parent or guardian is not fit to make
decisions concerning the child; and (ii) The marriage is not in the child's best interest.
There shall be a waiting period of five (5) business days for any marriage license issued
under this subsection.
If a child has a pending case in the circuit court, a parent or guardian who files consent
under this subsection shall immediately notify the circuit court, all parties, and attorneys to
the pending case.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-102.
But also see Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015), the Constitution entitles same-sex
couples to civil marriage “on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples.”
Age of Consent Exceptions
If an application for a marriage license is made where one (1) or both parties are under
eighteen years of age but older than sixteen years of age and the female is pregnant, both
1parties may appear before a judge of the circuit court of the district where the application
for a marriage license is being made. Evidence shall be submitted as to:
(A) The pregnancy of the female in the form of a certificate from a licensed and
regularly practicing physician of the State of Arkansas;
(B) The birth certificates of both parties; and
(C) Parental consent of each party who may be under the minimum age.
Thereupon, after consideration of the evidence and other facts and circumstances, if the
judge finds that it is to the best interest of the parties, the judge may enter an order
authorizing and directing the county clerk to issue a marriage license to the parties.
The county clerk shall retain a copy of the order on file in the clerk's office with the other
papers.
However, if the female has given birth to the child, the court before whom the parties are to
appear, if satisfied that it would be to the best interests of all the interested parties and if all
the requirements are complied with, with the exception of the physician's certificate as to
the pregnancy, may enter an order authorizing and directing the county clerk to issue a
marriage license as provided.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-103.
In all cases in which the consent of the parent or parents or guardian is not provided, or
there has been a misrepresentation of age by a contracting party, the marriage contract
may be set aside and annulled upon the application of the parent or parents or guardian to
the circuit court having jurisdiction of the cause. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-104.
The marriage of any male under the full age of seventeen (17) years and the marriage of any
female under the full age of sixteen (16) years is voidable.
All marriages contracted prior to March 26, 1964, where one (1) or both parties to
the contract were under the minimum age prescribed by law for contracting
marriage are declared to be voidable only and shall be valid for all intents and
purposes unless voided by a court of competent jurisdiction.
All marriages contracted between July 30, 2007, and April 2, 2008, in which one (1)
or both parties to the contract were under the minimum age prescribed by law for
contracting marriage are voidable only and are valid for all intents and purposes
unless voided by a court of competent jurisdiction.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-105.
2See State v. Graves, 228 Ark. 378, 307 S.W.2d 545 (1957)(where girl and boy, both residents
of Arkansas, were less than minimum age for marriage in Arkansas, went to Mississippi
which allowed marriages between persons of their ages, and were married with their
parents' consent and returned to Arkansas and lived there as man and wife, marriage was
not void).
Persons Who May Solemnize Marriage
(1) The Governor;
(2) Any former justice of the Supreme Court;
(3) Any judges of the courts of record within this state, including any former judge of a court
of record who served at least four (4) years or more;
(4) Any justice of the peace, including any former justice of the peace who served at least
two (2) terms since the passage of Arkansas Constitution, Amendment 55;
(5) Any regularly ordained minister or priest of any religious sect or denomination;
(6) The former mayor of any city of the first or second class who served at least five years as
mayor or the current mayor of any city or town;
(7) Any official appointed for that purpose by the quorum court of the county where the
marriage is to be solemnized; or
(8) Any elected district court judge and any former municipal or district court judge who
served at least four (4) years.
(9) The Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) through their traditional rites.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-213.
Marriage Licenses
All persons contracting marriage in this state are required to first obtain a license from the
clerk of the county court of some county in this state. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-201.
The form of the license can be found in Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-202.
The clerks of the county courts are required to furnish the license upon 1) an application’s
being made, 2) being fully assured that applicants are lawfully entitled to the license, and 3)
receipt of his or her fee. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-203. In 2015, the legislature added
subsection (d) “It is not a requirement that a marriage license be signed by a county clerk for
the license to be effective.”
3The license is required to be returned to the clerk within 60 days. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-218.
But see Fryar v. Roberts, 346 Ark. 432, 57 S.W.3d 727 (2001)(failure to file marriage license
within 60 days does not render a marriage void and stating marriage license statutes are
merely directory and not mandatory- as distinguished from the solemnization statutes).
Common Law Marriage
Arkansas does not recognize common law marriages within the boundaries of this state.
Fryar v. Roberts, 346 Ark. 432 (2001); Spicer v. Spicer, 239 Ark. 1013 (1965); Furth v. Furth,
97 Ark. 272 (1911).
All marriages contracted in other states are valid in Arkansas. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-107.
Note: for validity of Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-107 in regard to marriage between
persons of the same sex, see Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584 (2015); Jernigan v.
Crane, 64 F.Supp.3d 1260 (2014); and Jernigan v. Crane, 796 F.3d 976, (8th Cir. 2015)
(same-sex couples brought action against state officials challenging constitutionality
of Arkansas laws denying them right to marry- they won on summary judgment.)
See Craig v. Carrigo, 353 Ark. 761 (2003)(no valid common law marriage to be
recognized in Arkansas because Alberta, Canada had no statutory law and the
parties had not lived as married for the requisite time to meet the Alberta case law
definition); Brissett v. Sykes, 313 Ark. 515 (1993)(although common law marriages
valid in other states are recognized, evidence was insufficient to establish common
law marriage so as to give man right of survivorship in real property ); Knaus v.
Relyea, 24 Ark. App. 7 (1988)( insufficient objective evidence that agreement existed
between petitioner and the deceased to establish common-law marriage according
to Colorado law).
Covenant Marriage
A covenant marriage is a marriage entered into by one (1) male and one (1) female who
understand and agree that the marriage between them is a lifelong relationship.
Parties to a covenant marriage will have received authorized counseling emphasizing the
nature, purposes, and responsibilities of marriage.
Only when there has been a complete and total breach of the marital covenant commitment
may a party seek a declaration that the marriage is no longer legally recognized.
A man and a woman may contract a covenant marriage by declaring their intent to do so on
their application for a marriage license as otherwise required under this chapter and
executing a declaration of intent to contract a covenant marriage as provided in § 9-11-804.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-803.
4The application for a marriage license and the declaration of intent shall be filed
with the official who issues the marriage license.
The declaration of intent shall contain:
the requisite recitation found in § 9-11-804;
an affidavit by the parties that they have received authorized counseling,
such as that found in § 9-11-805;
an attestation of the counselor; and
the notarized signatures of parties, along with those required to consent if
they are minors.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-804.
A couple who is already married may redesignate their marriage as a covenant marriage.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-807.
Parties to a covenant marriage may only dissolve the covenant marriage by meeting the
requirements of Ark. Code Ann. §§ 9-11-808, 809, and 810.
These requirements include the following grounds for divorce:
(1) The other spouse has committed adultery;
(2) The other spouse has committed a felony or other infamous
crime;
(3) The other spouse has physically or sexually abused the spouse seeking
the divorce or a child of one (1) of the spouses;
(4) The spouses have been living separate and apart continuously without
reconciliation for a period of two (2) years; or
(5)(A) The spouses have been living separate and apart continuously
without reconciliation for a period of two years from the date the judgment
of judicial separation was signed; or (B)(i) If there is a minor child or children
of the marriage, the spouses have been living separate and apart
continuously without reconciliation for a period of two years and six months
from the date the judgment of judicial separation was signed. (ii) However,
if abuse of a child of the marriage or a child of one (1) of the spouses is the
basis for which the judgment of judicial separation was obtained, then a
judgment of divorce may be obtained if the spouses have been living
separate and apart continuously without reconciliation for a period of one
(1) year from the date the judgment of judicial separation was signed.
5And the following grounds for a judicial separation:
(1) The other spouse has committed adultery;
(2) The other spouse has committed a felony and has been sentenced to
death or imprisonment;
(3) The other spouse has physically or sexually abused the spouse seeking
the legal separation or divorce or a child of one (1) of the spouses;
(4) The spouses have been living separate and apart continuously without
reconciliation for a period of two (2) years; or
(5) The other spouse shall:
(A) Be addicted to habitual drunkenness for one (1) year;
(B) Be guilty of such cruel and barbarous treatment as to endanger
the life of the other; or
(C) Offer such indignities to the person of the other as shall render
his or her condition intolerable.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-808
II. Divorce
Jurisdiction
The circuit court shall have power to dissolve and set aside a marriage contract. Ark. Code
Ann. § 9-12-301.
The action for divorce shall be by equitable proceedings. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-302.
Venue
The proceedings shall be in the county where the complainant resides unless the
complainant is a nonresident of the State of Arkansas and the defendant is a resident of the
state, in which case the proceedings shall be in the county where the defendant resides. In
any event, the process may be directed to any county in the state.
See Hargis v. Hargis, 292 Ark. 487, 731 S.W.2d 198 (1987)(venue of an action may be
waived-- citing “the settled rule is that an objection to venue is waived by a
defendant who enters his appearance...” )
6When a spouse initiates an action against the other spouse for an absolute divorce, divorce
from bed and board, or separate maintenance, then the venue for the initial action shall also
be the venue for any of the three (3) named actions filed by the other spouse, regardless of
the residency of the other spouse. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-303.
See Tortorich v. Tortorich (“Tortorich III”), 333 Ark. 15, 968 S.W.2d 53 (1998)(order
of absolute divorce, which was obtained after limited divorce was granted in
another county, did not render order of chancellor from county that granted limited
divorce, which order increased husband's alimony obligation, ineffectual during
period before absolute divorce was reversed on appeal for improper venue).
The court issuing a final decree of divorce retains jurisdiction for all matters following entry
of the decree. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-320.
However, either party, or the court on its own motion, may petition the court to
request that the case be transferred to another county if:
(a) Both of the parties to the divorce proceedings have established a
residence in a county of another judicial district within the state; or
(b) One (1) of the parties has moved to a county of another judicial district
within the state and the other party has moved from the State of Arkansas.
The decision to transfer a case is within the discretion of the court where the final decree of
divorce was rendered.
The case shall not be transferred absent a showing that the best interest of the parties
justifies the transfer.
In cases in which children are involved and a justification for transfer of the case has been
made, there shall be an initial presumption for transfer of the case to the county of
residence of the custodial parent.
If the court that granted the final decree agrees to transfer the case to another judicial
district, the court shall enter an order transferring the case and charging the circuit clerk of
the court of original jurisdiction to transmit forthwith certified copies of all records
pertaining to the case.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-320.
Matters Which Must Be Proved
To obtain a divorce, the plaintiff must prove a legal cause for divorce which are listed in Ark.
Code Ann. § 9-12-301.
7See Dee v. Dee, 99 Ark. App. 159, 258 S.W.3d 405 (2007)(petitioner failed to prove
statutory grounds of general indignities- simply stated “general indignities” without
example; even though defendant/appellant admitted that he had waived
corroboration of grounds, the injured party must always prove statutory grounds
whether divorce is contested or uncontested; granting of divorce was reversed and
dismissed).
The plaintiff must also prove residency by a showing of residence in the state by either the
plaintiff or defendant for sixty (60) days immediately before the commencement of the
action and a residence in the state for three (3) full months before the final judgment
granting the decree of divorce. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-307.
No decree of divorce, however, shall be granted until at least thirty (30) days have
elapsed from the date of the filing of the complaint.
When personal service cannot be had upon the defendant or when the defendant
fails to enter his or her appearance in the action, no decree of divorce shall be
granted the plaintiff until the plaintiff has maintained an actual residence in the
State of Arkansas for a period of not less than three (3) full months. Ark. Code Ann.
§ 9-12-307.
See Rogers v. Rogers, 90 Ark. App. 321, 205 S.W.3d 856 (2005)(residency must be
proved and corroborated in every instance and the question of whether it has been
proven and corroborated is jurisdictional); Hodges v. Hodges, 27 Ark. App. 250, 770
S.W.2d 164 (1989)(same).
Plaintiff must also show that the cause of the divorce occurred or existed in this state or, if
out of the state, that it was a legal cause of divorce in this state, and that the cause of
divorce occurred or existed within five (5) years next before the commencement of the suit.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-307.
Grounds for Divorce
A plaintiff who seeks to dissolve and set aside a covenant marriage shall state in his or her
petition for divorce that he or she is seeking to dissolve a covenant marriage.
Grounds for absolute divorce or divorce from bed and board are:
(1) When either party, at the time of the contract, was and still impotent;
(2) When either party shall be convicted of a felony or other infamous crime;
(3) When either party shall:
(A) Be addicted to habitual drunkenness for one (1) year;
8(B) Be guilty of such cruel and barbarous treatment as to endanger the life
of the other; or
(C) Offer such indignities to the person of the other as shall render his or her
condition intolerable;
(4) When either party shall have committed adultery subsequent to the marriage;
(5) When husband and wife have lived separate and apart from each other for
eighteen (18) continuous months without cohabitation;
(6) When husband and wife have lived separate and apart for three (3) consecutive
years without cohabitation by reason of the incurable insanity of one (1) of them.
(7) When either spouse legally obligated to support the other, and having the ability
to provide the other with the common necessaries of life, willfully fails to do so.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-301
Case Law
Existing statutory law does not allow spouse to stipulate to or waive grounds for divorce.
Harpole v. Harpole, 10 Ark. App. 298, 664 S.W.2d 480 (1989). Rachel v. Rachel, 21 Ark.App.
77, 733 S.W.2d 735 (1987).
Divorce is a creature of statute and can be granted only when statutory grounds have been
proved and corroborated. Mayland v. Mayland, 2019 Ark. App. 390, 586 S.W.3d 179.
Limited Divorce: To obtain limited divorce (from bed and board/divorce a mensa et
thoro”, it is necessary for moving spouse to establish grounds, which are same as those
specified for “absolute divorce,” (“divorce from the bonds of matrimony” or “divorce a
vinculo matrimonii”) Lytle v. Lytle, 266 Ark. 124, 583 S.W.2d 1 (1979).
Separate Maintenance: However, grounds and corroboration of grounds are
unnecessary in an action for separate maintenance. All that must be established are a
separation and an absence of fault. Kesterson v. Kesterson, 21 Ark.App. 287, 731 S.W.2d 786
(1987). There is no statutory authority for an action for separate maintenance; instead it is
maintained under the broad power of equity. Wood v. Wood, 54 Ark. 172, 15 S.W. 459
(1891). Also, in separate-maintenance action, a court cannot order absolute division of
marital property. See Kesterson.
Although a husband and wife may not feel married when separated, as a matter of law they
are married, and any voluntary sexual intercourse between a married person and a person
other than the offender's spouse constitutes “adultery.” Atkinson v. Atkinson, 32 S.W.3d
41, 72 Ark. App. 15 (2000).
9Adultery may be proven by evidence leading to an inference of guilt. Lytle v. Lytle, 266 Ark.
124, 583 S.W.2d 1 (1979).
To constitute “cruel treatment” as ground for divorce, there must be proof of willfulness or
malice of offending spouse and that such treatment impairs or threatens impairment of
complaining party's health or is such as to cause mental suffering sufficient to make
condition of complaining party intolerable, and mere incompatibility of temperament or
want of congeniality is insufficient. Disheroon v. Disheroon, 211 Ark. 519, 201 S.W.2d 17
(1947).
Indignities to warrant divorce under statute must be habitual and systematically pursued to
extent rendering life of one on which they are imposed intolerable. Scales v. Scales, 167
Ark. 298, 268 S.W. 9 (1925).
Mere want of congeniality and constant quarrels are insufficient to constitute general
indignities justifying a divorce. The fact that parties to a marriage are not likely to live
together again does not warrant granting of a divorce on that ground. Copeland v.
Copeland, 2 Ark.App. 55, 616 S.W.2d 773 (1981).
Every minute detail of complainant’s testimony need not be corroborated to support
grounds of general indignities. Moore v. Davidson, 85 Ark. App.104; 145 S.W.3d 833 (2004).
Indignities must be proven by evidence of specific acts and conduct. Gunnell v. Gunnell, 30
Ark. App. 4; 780 S.W.2d 597(1989).
Mere incompatibility is not grounds for divorce in Arkansas. Poore v. Poore, 76 Ark. App. 99;
61 S.W.3d 912 (2001).
Pleadings which Require Verification by Affidavit
The pleadings are not required to be verified by affidavit.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-304. Exceptions:
Either party may file interrogatories to the other in regard to any matter of property
involved in the action that shall be answered on oath as interrogatories in other actions and
have the same effect.
Unless the court initiates proceedings on its own motion, any proceeding to punish for
contempt committed outside presence of court must be initiated by an affidavit of a person
who witnessed the contempt or otherwise has knowledge of it. Hilton Hilltop v. Riviere, 268
Ark. 532, 597 S.W.2d 596 (1980).
A notarized affidavit of financial means is to be exchanged by the parties at least three days
before a hearing to establish or modify a family-support order. The affidavit should not be
filed in the court file.
10Complaint Statements Require Proof
The statements of the complaint for a divorce shall not be taken as true because of the
defendant's failure to answer or admission of their truth on the part of the defendant. Ark.
Code Ann. § 9-12-305.
Corroboration
In uncontested divorce suits, corroboration of the plaintiff's grounds for divorce shall not be
necessary or required.
In contested suits, corroboration of the injured party's grounds may be expressly waived in
writing by the other spouse.
This section does not apply to proof as to residence, which must be corroborated, and does
not apply to proof of separation and continuity of separation without cohabitation, which
must be corroborated.
In uncontested cases, proof as to residence and proof of separation and continuity of
separation without cohabitation may be corroborated by either oral testimony or verified
affidavit of persons other than the parties.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-306.
Collusion
If it appears to the court that the adultery or other offense complained of has been
occasioned by the collusion of the parties or done with an intent to procure a divorce, that
the complainant was consenting thereto, or that both parties have been guilty of the
adultery or other offense or injury complained of in the complaint, then no divorce shall be
granted or decreed. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-308.
Condonation Abolished
The defense of condonation to any action for absolute divorce or divorce from bed and
board is abolished. Abolition of condonation does not affect the defenses of collusion,
consent, or equal guilt of the parties. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-325.
Maintenance and Attorney Fees
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-309.
During the pendency of an action for divorce, whether absolute or from bed and board,
separate maintenance, or alimony, the court may:
11Allow to the wife or to the husband maintenance;
Allow a reasonable fee for her or his attorneys; and
Allow expert witness fees; and
Enforce the payment of the allowance by orders and executions and proceedings as
in cases of contempt.
In the final decree of an action for absolute divorce, the court may award the wife or
husband costs of court, a reasonable attorney's fee, and expert witness fees.
The court may immediately reduce the sums so ordered to judgment and allow the party to
execute upon the marital property for the payment of the allowance, except that the
homestead shall not be executed upon for the payment of the sums so ordered.
The court may allow either party additional attorney's fees for the enforcement of alimony,
maintenance, and support provided for in the decree.
All child support that becomes due and remains unpaid shall accrue interest at the rate of
ten percent (10%) per annum. See also Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-233.
The court shall award a minimum of ten percent (10%) of the support amount due as
attorney's fees in actions for the enforcement of payment of alimony, maintenance, and
support provided for in the decree, judgment, or order.
Collection of interest and attorney's fees may be by executions, proceedings of contempt, or
other remedies as may be available to collect the original support award.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-309.
Case Law on Attorney’s Fees
In domestic-relations proceedings, the circuit court has the inherent power to award
attorney's fees, and the decision to award fees and the amount thereof are matters within
the discretion of the circuit court. Baber v. Baber, 2011 Ark. 40, 378 S.W.3d 699 (2011).
Also, see Tiner v. Tiner, 2012 Ark.App. 483, 422 S.W.3d 178 (2012). A court need not
conduct an exhaustive hearing on the amount of attorney's fees because it has presided
over the proceedings and gained familiarity with the case and the services rendered by the
attorney. Documentation of time and expense is not strictly required in a divorce case
where the trial court has had the opportunity to observe the parties, their level of
cooperation, and their obedience to court orders.
In determining whether to award attorney's fees in a divorce case, the trial court must
consider the relative financial abilities of the parties. Page v. Page, 2010 Ark. App. 188, 373
S.W.3d 408 (2010). But see Webb v. Webb, 2014 Ark. App. 697, 450 S.W.3d 265 (2014)
12finding that Page does not hold that a circuit court abuses its discretion in refusing to order
the party having more income to pay the other party’s attorney’s fees.
Parenting Classes
When the parties to a divorce action have minor children residing with one (1) or both
parents, the court, prior to or after entering a decree of divorce, may require the parties to
complete at least two (2) hours of classes concerning parenting issues faced by divorced
parents.
Each party shall be responsible for his or her cost of attending classes or mediation. Ark.
Code Ann. § 9-12-322.
Effect of Separation Agreements
Courts of equity may enforce the performance of written agreements between husband and
wife made and entered into in contemplation of either separation or divorce and decrees or
orders for alimony and maintenance by sequestration of the property of either party, or that
of his or her sureties, or by such other lawful ways and means, including equitable
garnishments or contempt proceedings, as are in conformity with rules and practices of
courts of equity. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-313.
The court is not bound by a stipulation entered into by the parties; rather, it is within the
sound discretion of the court to approve, disapprove, or modify parties' marital separation
agreement. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 81 Ark. App. 122, 98 S.W.3d 842 (2003).
Divorce Decree Contents
No decree of divorce shall be granted until at least thirty (30) days have elapsed from the
date of the filing of the complaint. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-307.
The decree should include an order containing provisions for:
Alimony (Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-312);
Child support, custody, visitation and dependent health care (Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-
312);
Division of property (Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-315);
Reservation of an estate by entirety (Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-317) if not to be
automatically dissolved; and
Restoration of the wife’s previous name (Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-318).
Division of debts - there is no presumption that an equal division of debts must
occur. Ellis v. Ellis, 75 Ark.App. 173, 57 S.W.3d 220 (2001). An allocation of the
13parties' debt is an essential item to be resolved in a divorce dispute, and that it must
be considered in the context of the distribution of all of the parties' property. Ellis
and Boxley v. Boxley, 77 Ark.App. 136, 73 S.W.3d 19 (2002). It is not error to
determine that debts should be allocated between the parties in a divorce case on
the basis of their relative ability to pay. Ellis. The effect of an allocation of debt on a
spouse's lifestyle is a valid consideration; the supreme court has affirmed unequal
debt allocations where a husband was able to pay the debts from income without
materially changing his style of life but the wife could not pay the debts from her
income without disposing of assets to pay part of the debt. Richardson v.
Richardson, 280 Ark. 498, 659 S.W.2d 510, (1983). When considering the allocation
of debts, it is also appropriate that the judge consider who should equitably be
required to pay them. Keathley v. Keathley, 76 Ark.App.150, 61 S.W.3d 219 (2001).)
In divorce decree dissolving a covenant marriage, the court shall enter a finding that the
marriage being dissolved is a covenant marriage. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-324.
Causes of Action
An absolute divorce, or a divorce from bed and board, is a statutory action based on the
grounds set out in Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-301. Property must be divided upon granting an
absolute divorce. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-315. Corroboration is required in contested cases.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-306.
An independent cause of action for alimony shall be by equitable proceedings. Ark. Code
Ann. § 9-12-302.
There are no meaningful distinctions between the action for alimony and an action for
separate maintenance. In an action for separate maintenance, it is unnecessary to establish
statutory grounds-- all that must be established are a separation and an absence of fault. In
a suit for separate maintenance, there is no statutory requirement for corroboration.
Property cannot be divided in a separate maintenance proceeding although possession may
be awarded. Child custody actions between parents are actions derivative of divorce or
separate maintenance. There is no independent cause of action by one parent against the
other solely for child custody. Spencer v. Spencer, 275 Ark. 112, 627 S.W.2d 550 (1982).
Kesterson v. Kesterson, 21 Ark.App. 287, 731 S.W.2d 786 (1987). There is no statutory
authority for an action for separate maintenance; instead it is maintained under the broad
power of equity. Wood v. Wood, 54 Ark. 172, 15 S.W. 459 (1891). Also, in separate-
maintenance action, a court cannot order absolute division of marital property. See
Kesterson and next section for more on Separate Maintenance.
See also Jones v. Earnest, 307 Ark. 294, 819 S.W.2d 280 (1991)(divorce from bed and board
does not constitute “final decree of divorce” so as to automatically dissolve tenancy by
entirety).
14III. Separate Maintenance
Authority
Until Lytle v. Lytle, a decree of separate maintenance did not exist as a separate cause of
action unrelated to a decree from bed and board. 266 Ark. 124, 583 S.W.2d 1 (1979).
There is no statutory authority. Separate maintenance is maintained under the broad
powers of equity. Kesterson v. Kesterson, 21 Ark. App. 287, 731 S.W.2d 786 (1987).
Grounds
For separate maintenance, a spouse must prove only separation, absence of fault on his or
her part, and financial need. The spouse is not required to prove any other grounds as listed
in Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-301.
A wife may obtain separate maintenance without having grounds sufficient for divorce. Hill
v. Rowles, 223 Ark. 115, 264 S.W.2d 638 (1954).
Grounds and corroboration of grounds are unnecessary in an action for separate
maintenance; all that must be established are a separation and an absence of fault.
Kesterson v. Kesterson, 21 Ark. App. 287, 731 S.W.2d 786 (1987).
Scope
Property cannot be divided in a separate maintenance proceeding although possession may
be awarded. Coleman v. Coleman, 7 Ark. App. 280, 648 S.W.2d 75 (1983).
Child custody actions between parents are actions derivative of divorce or separate
maintenance or domestic abuse actions. Kesterson v. Kesterson, 21 Ark. App. 287, 731
S.W.2d 786 (1987).
Trial court did not err in granting an absolute divorce upon wife’s filing a Complaint for
Separate Maintenance only where 1) neither party raised the issue, 2) both parties agreed
to a divorce, 3) both parties treated the Complaint for separate maintenance as a complaint
for divorce, 4) both parties stipulated to an equal division of marital property, and husband
waived corroboration of grounds for divorce, and 5) both parties consented to the hearing
being one for absolute divorce. Hiett v. Hiett, 86 Ark. App. 31, 158 S.W.3d 720 (2004).
IV.Division of Property & Debt
Equitable Distribution
15According to Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-315, at the time a divorce decree is entered, all marital
property shall be distributed one-half ( ½ ) to each party unless the court finds such a
division to be inequitable.
The court is not required to address the division of property at the time a divorce decree is
entered if either party is involved in a bankruptcy proceeding. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-315
Factors for Not Dividing Marital Property Equally
In that event the court shall make some other division that the court deems equitable taking
into consideration:
(i) The length of the marriage;
(ii) Age, health, and station in life of the parties;
(iii) Occupation of the parties;
(iv) Amount and sources of income;
(v) Vocational skills;
(vi) Employability;
(vii) Estate, liabilities, and needs of each party and opportunity of each for further
acquisition of capital assets and income;
(viii) Contribution of each party in acquisition, preservation, or appreciation of
marital property, including services as a homemaker; and
(ix) The federal income tax consequences of the court's division of property.
When property is divided pursuant to the foregoing considerations the court must state its
basis and reasons for not dividing the marital property equally between the parties, and the
basis and reasons should be recited in the order entered in the matter.
Case Law
The court must state its basis and reasons for not dividing the marital property
equally between the parties, and the basis and reasons should be recited in the
order. When a circuit court does not recite any of the statutory reasons why an
unequal distribution is equitable, reversal is required. However, the circuit court is
not required to list each factor in its order or to weigh each factor equally.
Moreover, the specific enumeration of the statutory factors does not preclude the
circuit court from considering other relevant factors, where exclusion of other
factors would lead to absurd results or deny the intent of the legislature to allow for
the equitable division of property. Middleton v. Middleton, 2020 Ark. App. 389.
16Exceptions to the rule of equal distribution will always depend on the specific facts
as reflected by the circuit court's findings and conclusions. The statute requires the
lower court simply to explain its reasons for not dividing the marital property
equally, not to recite each of the statutory factors in the order. Doss v. Doss, 2018
Ark. App. 487, 561 S.W.3d 348.
Equitable considerations are always proper factors for the chancellor to consider
when dividing marital property unequally upon divorce. Keathley v. Keathley, 76
Ark. App. 150, 61 S.W.3d 219 (2001).
The court should only consider potential taxes in valuing marital property in limited
circumstances, including only that tax liability can be reasonably predicted. Grace v.
Grace, 326 Ark. 312, 930 S.W.2d 362 (1996).
Marital vs. Nonmarital property
All nonmarital property shall be returned to the party who owned it prior to the marriage
unless the court shall make some other division that the court deems equitable taking into
consideration those factors enumerated above, in which event the court must state in
writing its basis and reasons for not returning the property to the party who owned it at the
time of the marriage.
9-12-315 states that for the purpose of division, “marital property” means all property
acquired by either spouse subsequent to the marriage except:
(1) Property acquired prior to marriage or by gift or by reason of the death of
another, including, but not limited to, life insurance proceeds, payments made
under a deferred compensation plan, or an individual retirement account, and
property acquired by right of survivorship, by a trust distribution, by bequest or
inheritance, or by a payable on death or a transfer on death arrangement;
(2) Property acquired in exchange for property acquired prior to the marriage or in
exchange for property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent;
(3) Property acquired by a spouse after a decree of divorce from bed and board;
(4) Property excluded by valid agreement of the parties;
(5) The increase in value of property acquired prior to marriage or by gift or by
reason of the death of another, including, but not limited to, life insurance
proceeds, payments made under a deferred compensation plan, or an individual
retirement account, and property acquired by right of survivorship, by a trust
distribution, by bequest or inheritance, or by a payable on death or a transfer on
death arrangement, or in exchange therefor;
17(6) Benefits received or to be received from a workers' compensation claim,
personal injury claim, or social security claim when those benefits are for any degree
of permanent disability or future medical expenses; and
(7) Income from property owned prior to the marriage or from property acquired by
gift or by reason of the death of another, including, but not limited to, life insurance
proceeds, payments made under a deferred compensation plan, or an individual
retirement account, and property acquired by right of survivorship, by a trust
distribution, by bequest or inheritance, or by a payable on death or a transfer on
death arrangement, or in exchange therefor.
Case Law
The trial court has broad powers to distribute both marital and
nonmarital property to achieve an equitable division. Ransom v. Ransom, 2009 Ark.
App. 273, 309 S.W.3d 204.
Note Moore v. Moore, 2016 Ark. 105, 486 S.W.3d 766, clarifying and overruling
prior cases which found that the appreciation in the value of nonmarital property
during the marriage can be a marital asset when one spouse makes significant
contributions of time, effort and skill which are directly attributable to the increase
in value of nonmarital property. Moore found that under section 9–12–315(b)(5)
the increase in value of property during a marriage is nonmarital, without exception,
and should be returned to the owning party. Moore overruled cases using this
“active appreciation” analysis/exception. Moore also reminds that the courts have
broad discretion and flexibility to redistribute marital and nonmarital property to
achieve an equitable distribution but that they must work within the confines of the
statute to accomplish this goal.
The fact that marital funds were used to pay off the mortgage loan on house that
wife owned prior to the marriage did not automatically convert the house into
marital property, for purposes of dividing property in divorce action. Horton v.
Horton, 2011 Ark. App. 361, 384 S.W.3d 61 (2011).
Option to purchase leased real property acquired during marriage was marital asset
subject to equitable distribution in divorce. Dew v. Dew, 2012 Ark. App. 122, 390
S.W.3d 764 (2012).
Once property, whether personal or real, is placed in the names of persons who are
husband and wife without specifying the manner in which they take, there is a
presumption that they own the property as tenants by the entirety, and clear and
convincing evidence is required to overcome that presumption. Powell v. Powell, 82
Ark. App. 17, 110 S.W.3d 290 (2003).
18Real Property
Every such final order or judgment shall designate the specific real and personal property to
which each party is entitled. When it appears from the evidence in the case to the
satisfaction of the court that the real estate is not susceptible of the division as provided for
in this section without great prejudice to the parties interested, the court shall order a sale
of the real estate. The sale shall be made by a commissioner to be appointed by the court
for that purpose at public auction to the highest bidder upon the terms and conditions and
at the time and place fixed by the court. The proceeds of every such sale, after deducting
the cost and expenses of the sale, including the fee allowed the commissioner by the court
for his or her services, shall be paid into the court and by the court divided among the
parties in proportion to their respective rights in the premises.
Ark. Code Ann. §9-12-315
Other Property Issues in 9-12-315
The proceedings for enforcing these orders may be by petition of either party specifying the
property the other has failed to restore or deliver, upon which the court may proceed to
hear and determine the same in a summary manner after ten (10) days' notice to the
opposite party. Such order, judgment, or decree shall be a bar to all claims of dower or
curtesy in and to any of the lands or personalty then owned or thereafter acquired by either
party;
When stocks, bonds, or other securities issued by a corporation, association, or government
entity make up part of the marital property, the court shall designate in its final order or
judgment the specific property in securities to which each party is entitled, or after
determining the fair market value of the securities, may order and adjudge that the
securities be distributed to one (1) party on condition that one-half ( ½ ) the fair market
value of the securities in money or other property be set aside and distributed to the other
party in lieu of division and distribution of the securities.
Debts
Arkansas Code Annotated section 9-12-315 does not apply to the division of marital debt,
and there is no presumption that an equal division of debts must occur. Williams v. Williams,
82 Ark. App. 294, 308, 108 S.W.3d 629, 638 (2003).
The circuit court has authority to consider the allocation of debt in the context of the
distribution of all of the parties’ property, and its decision to allocate debt to a particular
party or in a particular manner is a question of fact. McClure v. Schollmier-McClure, 2011
Ark. App. 681.
19A circuit court's allocation of debt based on the parties’ relative ability to pay is not a
decision that is clearly erroneous. Ellis v. Ellis, 75 Ark. App. 173, 177, 57 S.W.3d 220, 223
(2001).
Temporary Orders
Temporary Orders for Support, Attorney’s Fees, Expert Witness Fees
During the pendency of an action for divorce, whether absolute or from bed and board,
separate maintenance, or alimony, the court may allow to the wife or to the husband
maintenance, allow a reasonable fee for her or his attorneys, and allow expert witness fees.
The court may enforce the payment of the allowance by orders and executions and
proceedings as in cases of contempt. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-309.
Rule 65 TROs/Ex Parte Orders
A preliminary injunction or a temporary restraining order (TRO) may be granted without
written or oral notice to the adverse party or his attorney where it appears by affidavit or
verified complaint that irreparable harm or damage will or might result to the applicant if
such preliminary injunction or TRO is not granted. Ark. R. Civ. P. 65.
If it appears from affidavit or verified complaint that irreparable harm will or might result,
the court has the authority to issue a preliminary injunction or temporary restraining order
without notice to the opposing party. Otherwise, reasonable notice must be given to the
adverse parties or their attorney of the application for a preliminary injunction or a TRO, and
an opportunity for hearing must be given. Ark. R. Civ. P. 65.
Issued without notice? Rule requires an affidavit or verified complaint to state specific facts
showing the harm that will result to the movant before the adverse party can be heard and
requires that the movant's attorney certify in writing any efforts made to give notice and
why notice should not be required (b)(1); also requires that a temporary restraining order
issued without notice describe the circumstances underlying its issuance(b)(2). Ark. R. Civ. P.
65.
Every temporary restraining order issued without notice must expire not later than 14 days
after entry -- unless for good cause it is extended before the 14 day expiration or with the
adversary's consent it is extended. Also, the hearing on the temporary restraining order
must be set for the earliest possible time and take precedence over other matters. In
addition, the party against whom the order is issued may appear and move to dissolve or
modify the order upon 2 days' notice to the party who obtained the temporary restraining
order without notice. Ark. R. Civ. P. 65.
Caselaw: See Simmering v. Simmering; 2014 Ark. App. 722- In this type of request for
emergency relief, temporary relief may be provided upon proof of immediate or irreparable
20harm without emergency intervention by the court. See Ark. R. Civ. P. 65; see also Ark.Code
Ann. § 9–19–204 (Repl. 2009); 28 U.S.C.A. § 1738A(c)(2)(C); and Perez v. Tanner, 332 Ark.
356, 965 S.W.2d 90 (1998). The standard is high: immediate or irreparable harm. Thus, there
could conceivably be evidence that might not rise to a level sufficient to prove an
emergency but might still be sufficient to support a finding of a material change of
circumstances on a permanent change of custody request.
Temporary Orders of Protection
When a petition alleges an immediate and present danger of domestic abuse or that the
respondent is scheduled to be released from incarceration within thirty (30) days and upon
the respondent's release there will be an immediate and present danger of domestic abuse,
the court shall grant a temporary order of protection pending a full hearing if the court finds
sufficient evidence to support the petition. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-206.
An ex parte temporary order of protection is effective until the date of the hearing. Ark.
Code Ann. § 9-15-206.
The court shall order the hearing to be held on the petition for the order of protection not
later than thirty (30) days from the date on which the petition is filed or at the next court
date, whichever is later. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-204.
A denial of an ex parte temporary order of relief does not deny the petitioner the right to a
full hearing on the merits. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-204.
A copy of ex parte temporary order, if issued, shall be served, with copy of the petition, with
notice of the date and place set for final hearing, upon the respondent:
at least 5 days before the date of the hearing;
in accordance with applicable Rules of Civil Procedure governing service.
If service cannot be made upon the respondent, the court may set a new date for the
hearing. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-204.
An ex parte temporary order of protection may include any or all orders provided for in Ark.
Code. Ann. § 9-15-203 (Form of petition) and § 9-15-205 (Relief generally). Ark. Code Ann. §
9-15-206.
VI.Annulment
Venue
The action shall be by equitable proceedings in the county where the complainant or
complainants reside.
21The process may be directed in the first instance to any county in the state where the
defendant may then reside or be found.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-202.
Conflict of Laws
The validity of a marriage is determined by the law of the state where the marriage was
contracted. Feigenbaum v. Feigenbaum, 210 Ark. 186, 194 S.W.2d 1012 (1946).
Grounds for Annulment
When either of the parties to a marriage is incapable from want of age or understanding of
consenting to any marriage, or is incapable of entering into the marriage state due to
physical causes, or when the consent of either party shall have been obtained by force or
fraud, the marriage shall be void from the time its nullity shall be declared by a court of
competent jurisdiction. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-201.
Case Law
A state of marriage can be dissolved, by annulment, only during the lives of the parties to
the marriage. Stuhr v. Oliver, 2010 Ark. 189, 363 S.W.3d 316 (2010).
In Arkansas, a marriage may be annulled only for causes set forth by statute. Stuhr v. Oliver,
2010 Ark. 189, 363 S.W.3d 316 (2010).
Where girl and boy, both residents of Arkansas, were less than minimum age required by
Arkansas marriage statute and went to Mississippi which allowed such marriages and were
married with their parents' consent and returned to Arkansas and lived there as man and
wife, marriage was not void. State v. Graves, 228 Ark. 378, 307 S.W.2d 545 (1957).
A marriage induced by misrepresentation as to paternity of unborn child may be annulled,
where parties have been having sexual intercourse before marriage and husband was
induced to believe by false representations that he was father of child. Shatford v. Shatford,
214 Ark. 612, 217 S.W.2d 917 (1949).
Under the statute providing that in all cases where the male is under 21 years or the female
is under 18 years and consent of parent or guardian is not given to a marriage, the marriage
may be set aside and annulled upon application of parent or parents, the trial court has
some discretion in the matter and it is not mandatory for the chancellor to grant an
annulment upon application. Mitchell v. Mitchell, 219 Ark. 69, 239 S.W.2d 748 (1951).
Generally, a party lacks the mental capacity to enter into a contract for marriage if that
party is incapable of understanding the nature, effect, and consequences of the marriage.
The mental capacity necessary to enter into marriage does not require the ability to exercise
22clear reason, discernment, and sound judgment. Porter v. Arkansas Dep't of Health &
Human Servs. 374 Ark. 177, 286 S.W.3d 686 (2008).
To annul a marriage, fraud must be established by clear and convincing evidence. Worden v.
Worden, 231 Ark. 858, 333 S.W.2d 494 (1960).
Failure to file a marriage license within 60 days, as required by Ark. Code Ann. §9-11-218,
does not render a marriage void. Fryar v. Roberts, 346 Ark. 432, 57 S.W.3d 727 (2001).
Child Custody & Support in Connection with Annulment
A court of equity entering an annulment decree has authority to award custody of children
and provide for their support. See Ark. Code Ann. §9-12-312.
Marriage Before Entry of Divorce
All marriages declared void because the parties had entered into an otherwise valid
marriage after the rendition of a valid decree of divorce of either of the parties but before
the entry for record of the decree are declared valid for all purposes.
All children born to any marriage declared valid by this section are deemed to be the
legitimate children of both parents for all purposes.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-706. The legislative intent was to validate marriages deemed void as
a result of Standridge v. Standridge, 298 Ark. 494, 769 S.W.2d 12 (1989).
VII. Alimony
Authority
When a decree is entered, the court shall make an order concerning the care of the children,
if there are any, and an order concerning alimony, if applicable, as are reasonable from the
circumstances of the parties and the nature of the case. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-312.
The court’s jurisdiction to grant a divorce is distinct from its jurisdiction to award alimony
and child support. Rogers v. Rogers, 80 Ark. App. 430, 97 S.W.3d 429 (2003)(trial court has
power and duty to enter orders regarding support of individuals regardless of its power to
terminate the marriage).
Maintenance & Attorney’s Fees in Temporary Order
The court may grant either party maintenance and reasonable attorney fees during the
pendency of an action for absolute divorce, bed and board divorce, separate maintenance,
or alimony, or during the enforcement of alimony, maintenance, or support action. Ark.
Code Ann. § 9-12-309.
23Considerations in Awarding Alimony
An award of alimony is not mandatory but rather is discretionary, and the circuit court's
decision regarding any such award will not be reversed on appeal absent an abuse of that
discretion. This court has recognized that a circuit court is in the best position to view the
needs of the parties in connection with an alimony award. Smithson v. Smithson, 2014 Ark.
App. 340, 436 S.W.3d 491.
The purpose of alimony is to rectify the frequent economic imbalance in the earning power
and standard of living of the divorced parties in light of the particular facts of each case.
Hiett v. Hiett, 86 Ark. App. 31, 158 S.W.3d 720 (2004).
The primary factors to be considered in awarding alimony are the need of one spouse and
the other spouse's ability to pay. Kuchmas v. Kuchmas, 368 Ark. 43, 49, 243 S.W.3d 270, 273
(2006).
The amount of alimony should not be reduced to a mathematical formula because the need
for flexibility outweighs the need for relative certainty. Kuchmas v. Kuchmas, 368 Ark. 43
The need for flexibility outweighs the need for relative certainty in assessing alimony.
If alimony is awarded at all, it should be an amount that is reasonable under all the
circumstances. Smithson v. Smithson, 2014 Ark. App. 340, 436 S.W.3d 491.
Secondary factors to be considered in an award of permanent or rehabilitative alimony
include the following: (1) the financial circumstances of both parties; (2) the couple's past
standard of living; (3) the value of jointly owned property; (4) the amount and nature of the
parties' income, both current and anticipated; (5) the extent and nature of the resources
and assets of each of the parties; (6) the amount of income of each that is spendable; (7) the
earning ability and capacity of each party; (8) the property awarded or given to one of the
parties, either by the court or the other party; (9) the disposition made of the homestead or
jointly owned property; (10) the condition of health and medical needs of both husband and
wife; (11) the duration of the marriage; and (12) the amount of child support. Fault is not a
factor in the award of alimony unless it meaningfully relates to need or ability to pay. Foster
v. Foster, 2016 Ark. 456.
See also:
William v. Williams, 2018 Ark. App. 79 (the court ordered alimony amount was
found unreasonable given the fact that after the husband’s monthly expenses are
taken care of, he is left with $1,206.64 from which he has to pay appellee $1,100
in alimony, leaving appellant with only a little over $100 after this payment.)
24Hiett v. Hiett, 86 Ark. App. 31, 158 S.W.3d 720 (2004)( trial court considered factors
and properly found that ex-wife entitled to lifetime award of alimony);
Holaway v. Holaway, 70 Ark. App. 240, 16 S.W.3d 302 (2000)(while the court may
consider disparate levels of parties’ earning abilities and sources of income, court
cannot set alimony at a rate and for a time based upon the court’s inability by law to
divide husband’s non-vested military retirement benefits);
Bolan v. Bolan, 32 Ark. App. 65, 796 S.W.2d 358 (1990)(chancellor did not abuse
discretion in refusing to award alimony after considering factors; found that
marriage was of short duration, plaintiff was relatively young and had a college
degree and teaching certificate and no health problems);
Mearns v. Mearns, 58 Ark. App. 42, 946 S.W.2d 188 (1997)(husband was entitled to
alimony where he was unemployed, 57 years old, in declining health, without
college degree or professional license, and without independent financial means,
while wife had secure job paying more than $40,000 per year).
Rehabilitative Alimony
Alimony may be awarded under proper circumstances concerning rehabilitation to
either party in fixed installments for a specified period of time so that the payments
qualify as periodic payments within the meaning of the Internal Revenue Code.
When a request for rehabilitative alimony is made to the court, the payor may
request, or the court may require, the recipient to provide a plan of rehabilitation
for the court to consider in determining:
(A) Whether or not the plan is feasible; and
(B) The amount and duration of the award.
If the recipient fails to meet the requirements of the rehabilitative plan, the payor
may petition the court for a review to determine if rehabilitative alimony shall
continue or be modified.
A person paying alimony is entitled to petition the court for a review, modification,
or both of the court's alimony order at any time based upon a significant and
material change of circumstances.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-312(b).
The concept of rehabilitative alimony shall be analyzed using the same factors that
apply to permanent alimony. Rehabilitative alimony is “alimony payable for a short,
but specific and terminable period of time, which will cease when the recipient is, in
the exercise of reasonable efforts, in a position of self-support. Foster v. Foster,
2016 Ark. 456.
25Section 9-12-312(b) does not mandate that a rehabilitative plan be submitted or
approved; instead, the statute states that a plan “may” be requested by the payor
or required by the circuit court. Carr v. Carr, 2019 Ark. App. 513.
Agreement of the Parties Does Not have to be Approved by Court
The court is not bound by a stipulation entered into by the parties on alimony or
property division: rather, it is within the sound discretion of the court to approve,
disapprove, or modify the agreement. The Court has the means to approve and
enforce an agreement, but that does not limit the court's discretion to accept or
reject the agreement of the disputing parties. Rutherford v. Rutherford, 81 Ark.
App. 122, 98 S.W.2d 842 (2003).
Bankruptcy and Alimony
Bankruptcy does not discharge obligation to pay alimony. Barker v. Barker, 271 Ark. 956, 611
S.W.2d 787 (Ct. App. 1981); 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(5).
Modification of Alimony
The court, upon application of either party, may make such alterations from time to time, as
to the allowance of alimony and maintenance as may be proper. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-314.
See Holaway v. Holaway, 70 Ark. App. 240, 16 S.W.3d 302 (2000)( order that
parties.
alimony would terminate only upon the death of either party appears to violate
statutory and case authority in Arkansas that, in the absence of a settlement
agreement to the contrary, an award of alimony is always subject to modification,
upon application of either party).
Modification of an award of alimony must be based on a change in the circumstances of the
See Honeycutt v. Honeycutt, 2017 Ark. App. 113 (Order reducing former husband's
alimony obligation was not an abuse of discretion; former husband was laid off after
an economic downturn in his employment field, he made a good faith effort to find
new employment, and he incurred additional expenditures due to former wife's lack
of cooperation in applying for Social Security disability benefits and her refusal to
sign the parties' joint income tax return.)
But also see Cherry v. Cherry, 2021 Ark. 49 (trial court correctly determined that it
did not need to reassess husband's alimony obligation, even though wife was
unemployed when the award was determined and she had since obtained
employment, was not clearly erroneous; while wife's employment situation had
improved, it was not so great as to make alimony unnecessary, and wife's monthly
expenses were essentially the same)
26The burden of showing such a change in circumstances is always upon the party seeking the
change in the amount of alimony.
The primary factors to be considered in making or changing an award of alimony are the
need of one spouse and the ability of the other spouse to pay.
A finding of changed circumstances warranting the termination of an alimony obligation is a
finding of fact that will not be reversed unless clearly erroneous or clearly against the
preponderance of the evidence.
Hass v. Hass, 80 Ark. App. 408, 412, 97 S.W.3d 424, 427 (2003).
If a spouse shows a need for alimony, and the other spouse is shown to have the ability or
earning capacity to pay alimony except for a circumstance at the time the parties' decree is
entered, the chancellor may reserve jurisdiction, without assigning a nominal amount. This
procedure would permit the spouse requesting alimony to petition for its payment after
showing a change in circumstance. Mulling v. Mulling, 323 Ark. 88 (1996), overruling Ford v.
Ford, 272 Ark. 506 (1981).
When a decree of alimony is based on an independent contract between the parties which
is incorporated into the decree and approved by the Court as an independent contract, it
does not merge into the court's award and is not subject to modification except upon
consent of the parties. Rockefeller v. Rockefeller, 335 Ark. 145, 980 S.W.2d 255 (1998);
Kersh v. Kersh, 254 Ark. 969, 497 S.W.2d 272 (1973); Kennedy v. Kennedy, 53 Ark. App. 22,
918 S.W.2d 197 (1996).
See also Grady v. Grady, 295 Ark. 94, 747 S.W.2d 77 (1988)(court may consider fact that
supporting spouse voluntarily changes employment so as to lessen earning capacity and, in
turn, ability to pay alimony and child support, and may in proper circumstances impute
income to spouse according to what could be earned by use of his or her best efforts to gain
employment suitable to his or her capabilities).
Termination of Alimony
Unless otherwise ordered by the court or agreed to by the parties, the liability for alimony
shall automatically cease upon the earlier of:
(A) The date of the remarriage of the person who was awarded the alimony;
(B) The establishment of a relationship that produces a child or children and results
in a court order directing another person to pay support to the recipient of alimony,
which circumstances shall be considered the equivalent of remarriage;
(C) The establishment of a relationship that produces a child or children and results
in a court order directing the recipient of alimony to provide support of another
27person who is not a descendant by birth or adoption of the payor of the alimony,
which circumstances shall be considered the equivalent of remarriage;
(D) The living full time with another person in an intimate, cohabitating relationship;
(E) The death of either party; or
(F) Any other contingencies as set forth in the order awarding alimony.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-312.
See Estate of Carpenter v. Carpenter, 220 S.W.3d 263 (2005)( husband's obligation to pay
wife $500 per week in alimony for period of five years terminated upon husband's death,
but estate was liable for any alimony arrearages accrued at time of death).
See also Collins v. Collins, 2015 Ark. App. 525, 471 S.W.3d 665 (evidence was sufficient to
support finding that former wife and boyfriend were “cohabitating” within meaning of
property-settlement agreement which provided that former husband's alimony payments
would terminate upon wife's “remarriage or cohabitation”; while they did not share
financial expenses and had separate homes, there was evidence boyfriend spent two or
three nights a week at former wife's home, sometimes more, and that he spent most of one
month there while new house was being constructed; also, separate and independent
property-settlement agreement that has been incorporated into a divorce decree leaves a
trial court without authority to modify the agreement; rather, the issue of whether alimony
should be terminated is based on an analysis of the contract language.)
VIII. Child Support
Administrative Order No. 10 was revised in 2020. A complete copy of the law can be found at:
https://www.arcourts.gov/content/administrative-order-10-arkansas-child-support-guidelines
Arkansas Code Annotated section 9-12-312(a)(4)(A)(i) mandates that a committee appointed by the
Chief Justice of the Arkansas Supreme Court review the Arkansas Family Support Chart every four years. The
Supreme Court promulgated a revised order concerning child-support obligations in 2020. In re
Implementation of Revised Admin. Ord. No. 10, 2020 Ark. 131 (per curiam). In accordance with Act 907 of
2019, the new family support chart is based on the “Income Shares Model,” which provides “that children
should receive the same proportion of parental income that they would have received had the parents lived
together and shared financial resources.” The new order provides that “each parent's share is that parent's
prorated share of the two parents’ combined income.” “The pro-rata charted amount establishes the base
level of child support” the payor parent must pay the payee parent. And a “rebuttable presumption” exists
that this chart-derived amount “is the amount to be awarded.” See Parnell v. OCSE, 2022 Ark. 52.
Parnell v. OCSE sets out the relevant procedure:
The gross income of both parents shall first be determined and combined. Each parent's share of the
combined total gross income is then determined based on their percentage of the combined income. Next,
28the basic child-support obligation is determined by looking at the Chart for the parties’ combined income
and the number of children they have. A presumptive child-support obligation is then determined by adding
the allowed additional monthly child-rearing expenses (including health insurance premiums, extraordinary
medical expenses, and childcare expenses). Each parent's share of additional child-rearing expenses is
determined by multiplying the percentage of income they have available for support, which was determined
in step 1. The total child-support obligation for each parent is determined by adding each parent's share of
the child-support obligation with their share of allowed additional child-rearing expenses. Parnell v. OCSE,
2022 Ark. 52.
The child-support scheme in Arkansas is governed by Arkansas Supreme Court Administrative Order
No. 10, which includes a family-support chart that sets the amount of support due based on the payor's
income. It is a rebuttable presumption that the amount contained in the family-support chart is the correct
amount of child support to be awarded. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-312(a)(3)(C) The amount
of child support calculated pursuant to the most recent revision of the Chart is presumed to be the correct
amount of child support to award in any judicial proceeding involving child support. See Ark. Sup. Ct. Admin.
Order No. 10(II) See Olinghouse v. Olinghouse, 2022 Ark. App. 114.
Jurisdiction
The circuit courts shall have exclusive jurisdiction in all civil cases and matters relating to the support
of a minor child or support owed to a person eighteen (18) or older that accrued during that person's
minority. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-105.
Any person who establishes or acquires a marital domicile in this state, who contracts marriage in
this state, or who becomes a resident of this state while legally married, and subsequently absents himself
or herself from the state leaving a dependent natural or adopted child in this state and fails to support the
child as required by the laws of this state, is deemed to have consented and submitted to the jurisdiction of
the courts of this state as to any cause of action brought against that person for the support and
maintenance of the child. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-101.
In an action to establish paternity or to establish or enforce a child support obligation in regard to a
child who is the subject of the action, a person is deemed to have consented and submitted to the
jurisdiction of the courts of this state if any of the following circumstances exists:
(1) The person engaged in sexual intercourse with the child's mother in this state
during the period of the child's conception or the affected child was conceived in
this state;
(2) The person resides or has resided with the child in this state.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-101.
Service of process upon any person who is deemed by this section to have consented and submitted
to the jurisdiction of the courts of this state may be made pursuant to Rule 4 of the Arkansas Rules of Civil
Procedure. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-101.
A court's jurisdiction to grant a divorce is distinct from its jurisdiction to award child support and
alimony. Rogers v. Rogers, 80 Ark. App. 430, 97 S.W.3d 429 (2003).
29Transfer of Cases Between Local Jurisdictions- Child Support and Custody
The court where the final adjudication of child support is rendered shall retain jurisdiction of
all matters following the entry of the decree.
If more than six (6) months subsequent to the final adjudication, however, each of the
parties to the action has established a residence in a county of another judicial district
within the state, one (1) or both of the parties may petition the court that entered the final
adjudication to request that the case be transferred to another county.
The case shall not be transferred absent a showing that the best interest of the parties
justifies the transfer.
If a justification for transfer of the case has been made, there shall be an initial presumption
for transfer of the case to the county of residence of the physical custodian of the child.
At the request of the person seeking to transfer the case to another judicial district, upon
proper motion and affidavit, notice and payment of a refiling fee, the court shall enter an
order transferring the case and the refiling fee and charging the clerk of the court to
transmit forthwith certified copies of all records pertaining to the case to the clerk of court
in the judicial district where the case is being transferred.
An affidavit shall accompany the motion to transfer and recite that the parent or
parents, the physical custodian, and the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the
Revenue Division of the Department of Finance and Administration, as appropriate,
have been notified in writing that a request has been made to transfer the case to
another judicial district.
Notification pursuant to this section must inform each recipient that any objection
must be filed within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt of the affidavit and
motion for transfer.
The circuit clerk receiving a transferred case shall within fourteen (14) days of receipt set up
a case file, docket the case, and afford the case full faith and credit as if the case had
originated in that judicial district.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-108.
Petition for Order of Support
The following may file a petition to require the noncustodial parent or parents of a minor
child to provide support for the minor child:
(1) Any parent having physical custody of a minor child;
(2) Any other person or agency to whom physical custody of a minor child has been
given or relinquished;
(3) A minor child by and through his or her guardian or fictive kin; or
(4) The Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Revenue Division of the
Department of Finance and Administration when a person to whom physical
30custody has been relinquished or awarded, parent, or putative father is receiving
certain assistance or services, or has contracted with the department for the
collection of support.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-105.
Attorney employed by OCSE represents the interests of that office and does not
represent the assignor. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-210.
Any person eighteen (18) years of age or above to whom support was owed during his or
her minority may file a petition for a judgment against the nonsupporting parent or parents.
Upon hearing, a judgment may be entered upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence
for the amount of support owed and unpaid. Such a person has 5 years from his eighteenth
birthday to file a petition for owed support. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-105.
Child was entitled to bring action for, and receive, accrued child support from his
father from date on which he left his mother's residence and moved in with his
maternal grandparents until his eighteenth birthday, even though father was not
then under court order to pay support. Fonken v. Fonken, 334 Ark. 637, 976 S.W.2d
952 (1998).
Parties to a case must provide the clerk of the appropriate circuit court with the following
information: names, residential and mailing addresses, social security numbers, telephone
numbers, drivers’ license numbers, and names and addresses of employers, where
applicable.
This information shall be filed on a form provided by the AOC and maintained
separately by the clerk from the file of the case. The information is considered
confidential and is open to inspection only by OCSE, attorneys in the case and pro se
parties, and anyone authorized access by the circuit court in which the form is filed.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-205.
“Child support order” or “support order” means a judgment, decree, or order, whether
temporary, final, or subject to modification, issued by a court or an administrative agency of
competent jurisdiction for the support and maintenance of a child, including a child who has
attained the age of majority under the law of the issuing state, or of the parent with whom
the child is living, that provides for monetary support, health care, including health
insurance or cash medical support, arrearages, or reimbursement, and that may include
related costs and fees, interest and penalties, income withholding, attorney's fees, and
other relief. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-201.
Enforcement Provisions
In all decrees or orders that provide for the payment of money for the support and care of
any children, the court shall include a provision directing a payor to deduct from:
Money, income, or periodic earnings due the noncustodial parent an amount that is
sufficient to meet the periodic child support payments imposed by the court plus an
additional amount of not less than twenty percent (20%) of the periodic child
31support payment to be applied toward liquidation of any accrued arrearage due
under the order; and
Any lump-sum payment as defined in § 9-14-201, the full amount of past due
support owed by the noncustodial parent not to exceed fifty percent (50%) of the
net lump-sum payment. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-218.
The use of income withholding does not constitute an election of remedies and does not
preclude the use of other enforcement remedies. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-218.
See Stewart v. Norment, 328 Ark. 133, 941 S.W.2d 419 (1997)(order for child-
support arrearages is final judgment subject to garnishment or execution until order
is modified or otherwise set aside, regardless of whether order also provides for
income withholding to satisfy accrued support arrearages, in view of statutes stating
that remedies provided in child-support enforcement subchapter shall not be
exclusive of other remedies and that use of income withholding in orders providing
for child support does not constitute election of remedies and does not preclude
use of other enforcement remedies).
In determining good cause, the court may take into consideration evidence of the degree of
the respondent's past financial responsibility, credit references, credit history, and any other
matter the court considers relevant in determining the likelihood of payment in accordance
with the support order. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-102.
Orders of income withholding for support shall have priority over all other legal processes
under state law against the money, income, or periodic earnings of the noncustodial parent.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-219.
If there is more than one (1) notice or order for income withholding for current child
support against a noncustodial parent and the total amount requested exceeds the limits
imposed under the Consumer Credit Protection Act, the payor shall make pro rata
disbursements, “pro rata” being the proportionate amount each notice or order bears to the
total amount due for current support under all notices and orders. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-
228.
See Bitzer v. Bitzer, 65 Ark. App. 162, 986 S.W.2d 122 (1999)(finding that father was
supporting his spouse, for purposes of determining the maximum percentage of his
income that could be withheld for child support under the Federal Consumer
Protection Act, was supported by evidence that father's spouse earned
approximately $3,100 per month, father earned approximately $4,000 per month,
father and spouse had a monthly mortgage payment of $1,400, total monthly
payment on two vehicles owned by father's spouse was $900, and father's spouse
was supporting a child from a previous marriage).
Any decree, judgment, or order that contains a provision for payment of money for the
support and care of any child or children through the registry of the court or through the
Arkansas child support clearinghouse shall become a lien upon all real property, not
otherwise exempt by the Arkansas Constitution, owned by the noncustodial parent or that
the noncustodial parent may afterwards, or before the lien expires, acquire. Ark. Code Ann.
§ 9-14-230.
32Such lien originating in another state shall be accorded full faith and credit as if such
lien originated in the State of Arkansas. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-230.
When a person is ordered by a court of record to pay for the support of his or her children,
the court, at the time an order of support is made or any time thereafter, upon a showing of
good cause, may order periodic drafts of his or her accounts at a financial institution to
deduct moneys due or payable for child support in amounts the court may find to be
necessary to comply with its order for the support of the children. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-
107.
Arrearage
“Accrued arrearage” means a delinquency that is past due and unpaid and owed under a
court order or an order of an administrative process established under state law for support
of any child or children. “Accrued arrearage” may include past due support that has been
reduced to a judgment if the support obligation under the order has not been terminated.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-201.
See Hendrickson v. State, Office of Child Support Enforcement ex rel. Henderson, 77
Ark. App. 103, 72 S.W.3d 124 (2002)(chancellor should have considered the
applicability of equitable estoppel to prevent enforcement of child support order
and collection of arrears).
“Overdue support” means a delinquency pursuant to an obligation created under a court
decree, order, or judgment or an order of an administrative process established under the
laws of another state for the support and maintenance of a minor child.
“Past due support” is the total amount of support determined under a court order
established under state law which remains unpaid.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-201.
All child support that becomes due and remains unpaid shall accrue interest at the rate of
ten percent (10%) per annum unless the owner of the judgment or the owner's counsel of
record requests prior to the accrual of the interest that the judgment shall not accrue
interest. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-233.
If the obligated parent who is not incapacitated refuses to pay past due support or refuses
to engage in work activities or seek work activities as ordered by the court, the court may
order the obligated parent to be incarcerated.
In any action brought for the enforcement of a child support obligation, whenever the court
orders an obligated parent to be incarcerated for failure to obey a previous order, the court
may further direct that the obligated parent be temporarily released from confinement to
engage in work activity upon such terms and conditions as the court deems just.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-233.
Any decree, judgment, or order that contains a provision for the payment of money for the
support and care of any child or children through the registry of the court or the Arkansas
child support clearinghouse shall be final judgment subject to writ of garnishment or
33execution as to any installment or payment of money that has accrued until the time either
party moves through proper motion filed with the court and served on the other party to set
aside, alter, or modify the decree, judgment, or order. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-234.
See Darr v. Bankston, 327 Ark. 723, 940 S.W.2d 481 (1997)(administrator of
mother's estate had standing to bring action against father for child support
arrearages, even though statute which defined “moving party” who could bring suit
for child–support arrearages did not specifically list administrator; administrator, as
appointed representative of mother's estate, was entitled under Probate Code to
enforce mother's estate's entitlement to any existing money or personal property
judgment or decree, and statute governing who could bring suit for child support
arrearages could be read in harmony with applicable probate provisions).
Existing child support order is a final order and is not subject to modification until a
motion for modification is filed, and it follows that, if no motion for modification is
filed, the existing judgment remains intact until such time as a proper motion is
filed. Martin v. Martin, 79 Ark. App. 309, 87 S.W.3d 817 (2002)(since no motion for
modification of child support had been filed by ex-husband, the trial court's
modification of the existing support order violated statute providing that any decree
which contains a provision for the payment of money for child support shall be final
judgment subject to writ of garnishment or execution as to any payment of money
which has accrued until the time either party moves to set aside or modify the
decree).
Any person eighteen (18) years of age or above to whom support was owed during his or
her minority may file a petition for a judgment against the nonsupporting parent or parents.
Upon hearing, a judgment may be entered upon proof by a preponderance of the evidence
for the amount of support owed and unpaid. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-105
If a child support arrearage or judgment exists at the time when any child entitled to
support reaches the age majority, is emancipated, or dies, or when the obligor's current
duty to pay child support otherwise ceases, the obligor shall continue to pay an amount
equal to the court-ordered child support, or an amount to be determined by a court based
on the application of guidelines for child support under the family support chart, until such
time as the child support arrearage or judgment has been satisfied. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-
235.
An action for arrearage may be brought at any time up to and including five (5) years
beyond the date the child for whose benefit the initial support order was entered reaches
eighteen (18) years of age. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-236.
See Clemmons v. Office of Child Support Enforcement, 345 Ark. 330, 47 S.W.3d 227
(2001)(mother had statutory right to bring action against father, after child reached
age 18, for arrearages of child support that had been payable before child reached
age 18, and thus, mother's assignment of such right to OCSE was valid).
No statute of limitation shall apply to an action brought for the collection of a child support
obligation or arrearage against any party who leaves or remains outside the State of
34Arkansas with the purpose to avoid the payment of child support. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-
236.
Res judicata applied to child support is a “modified res judicata,” which is subject to changed
circumstances and the best interest of the child. Office of Child Support Enforcement, et al.
v. King, 81 Ark. App. 190, 100 S.W.3d 95 (2003)(any past-due child support accrues and is a
judgment until altered prospectively by proper motion and order of the court. Here, no
court order modifying earlier order, so “modified res judicata” did not come into play).
The Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Revenue Division of the Department of
Finance and Administration shall provide individual monthly reports to the county circuit
clerk concerning money received by the office in payment of arrearages owed by a person
convicted of nonsupport. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-242.
Modification of Support
Consistent with 9-14-107(c)(2), Administrative Order No. 10 states that an inconsistency between an
existing child support award and the amount of child support that results from applying the Family Support
Chart shall be a material change of circumstances sufficient to petition the Court for modification of child
support after appropriate deductions unless one of these three exceptions apply:
• Doesn’t meet the quantitative standard (20%)
• Justified deviation that has not changed
• Inconsistency due solely to promulgation of revised Family Support Chart
A subsequent child support obligation shall not constitute the sole basis for a material change of
circumstances sufficient to support a petition to the court for modification of a prior child support order.
A change in a parent’s ability to provide health insurance may be a material change of
circumstances sufficient to petition for modification of child support.
The incarceration of a parent shall not be treated as voluntary unemployment for purposes
of determining a reasonable amount of support either initially or upon review.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-107.
Expedited Hearings
Child support and paternity cases brought pursuant to Title IV-D shall be heard within a
reasonable period of time following service.
Title IV-D cases, including paternity, have specific time periods within which they must be
heard.
The Chief Justice may direct redistribution of caseload or may appoint other trial judges to a
district to insure compliance with state and federal law in meeting time requirements of IV-
D cases.
Sheriff must make return of service or nonservice within 10 days in Title IV-D cases.
35Court clerk must file or docket IV-D papers on the date received but no later than the close
of business the day after papers are received in the clerk’s office.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-204.
Termination of Duty of Support
Unless a court order for child support specifically extends child support after these
circumstances, a payor parent's duty to pay child support for a child shall automatically
terminate by operation of law:
When the child reaches eighteen (18) years of age unless the child is still attending
high school. If the child is still attending high school, upon the child's high school
graduation or the end of the school year after the child reaches nineteen (19) years
of age, whichever is earlier;
When the child is emancipated by a court of competent jurisdiction, marries, or
dies; or
Upon the entry of a final decree of adoption or an interlocutory decree of adoption
that has become final under § 9-9-201 et seq. and thereby relieves the payor parent
of all parental rights and responsibilities.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-237.
The court may provide for the payment of child support beyond the eighteenth birthday of
the child to address the educational needs of a child whose eighteenth birthday falls before
graduation from high school so long as such child support is conditional on the child
remaining in school.
The court also may provide for the continuation of support for an individual with a
disability that affects the ability of the individual to live independently from the
custodial parent. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-312.
See Kimbrell v. Kimbrell, 47 Ark. App. 56, 884 S.W.2d 268 (1994)(chancellor did not
abuse discretion by ordering disabled father to pay $60 a month for support of
handicapped adult son; chancellor did not ignore son's independent source of
income but determined that son's necessary expenses exceeded his disability
income by $100 per month and in setting amount of support, he considered poor
financial conditions of both parents and concluded that each should share
responsibility for providing for son's needs based on their respective incomes and
relative abilities to pay and considered fact that mother was also disabled and that
her source of income was also derived from disability).
But see Aikens v. Lee, 53 Ark. App. 1, 918 S.W.2d 204 (1996)(no special
circumstances existed which would require father to continue making child support
payments until child finished college even though mother was contributing between
$120 and $150 per month towards college expenses; child had reached age of
majority, child worked 40 hours per week during summer, and child received college
scholarships).
36However, even if child support terminates by operation of law, any unpaid child support
obligations owed under a judgment or in arrearage pursuant to a child support order shall
be satisfied. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-237.
Also, see Mixon v. Mixon, 65 Ark. App. 240, 987 S.W.2d 284 (as a matter of law,
child support terminated upon his child's eighteenth birthday, as the child had
already graduated from high school; chancellor did not attempt to retroactively
modify a judgment and simply recalculated the actual amounts owed in obedience
to the law; there was no legal right to receive child support for emancipated child
when the General Assembly prescribed that support for that child would
“automatically terminate by operation of law.”)
Additionally, even if child support terminates by operation of law, for the remaining minor
children, support shall be determined:
by the court upon a motion filed within 30 days after expiration of the 10-day
provision to notify of termination of support; or
by operation of law after the 30-day period expires, using the most recent version of
the family support chart; or
by the court if the most recent order was entered prior to adoption of the guidelines
or if the most recent order deviated from the family support chart.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-237.
Deviations from the chart shall be noted in the Order or on the record as appropriate. Ark.
Code Ann. § 9-14-237.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-14-240 provides an administrative procedure for terminating income
withholding when the duty to support terminates.
Bankruptcy
Bankruptcy does not discharge obligation to pay child support. 11 U.S.C. § 523(a)(5).
Qualified Domestic Relations Orders
“Domestic relations order” means any judgment, decree, or order, including approval of a
property settlement agreement, that relates to the provisions for child support, alimony
payment, or marital property rights to a spouse, former spouse, child, or other dependents
of a participant under Arkansas law.
“Qualified domestic relations order” means a domestic relations order:
(A) Which creates or recognizes the existence of an alternate payee's right to, or
assigns to an alternate payee the right to, receive all or a portion of the benefits
payable with respect to a participant's retirement plan;
(B) Which clearly specifies the name and last known mailing address, if any, of the
participant and the name and mailing address of each alternate payee covered by
the order, the amount or percentage of the participant's benefits to be paid by the
37plan to each alternate payee or the manner in which the amount or percentage is
determined, the number of payments or period of time to which the order applies,
and each retirement plan to which the order applies; and
(C) Which does not require the retirement plan to provide any type or form of
benefit, or pay options not otherwise available under the plan, does not require the
plan to provide increased benefits, and does not require the payment of benefits to
an alternate payee that are required to be paid to another alternate payee under
another order previously determined to be a qualified domestic relations order
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-18-101.
The circuit courts of Arkansas are empowered to enter qualified domestic relations orders
to reach any and all retirement annuities and benefits of any retirement plan and to specify
that a designated percent of a fractional interest on any retirement benefit payment may be
paid to an alternate payee. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-18-102.
Any state-supported retirement system shall comply with any qualified domestic relations
order. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-18-103.
IX. Uniform Interstate Family Support Act (UIFSA)
Jurisdiction Under UIFSA
In a proceeding to establish, enforce, or modify a support order or to determine parentage
of a child, a tribunal of this state may exercise personal jurisdiction over a nonresident
individual or the individual's guardian or conservator if:
(1) the individual is personally served with summons within this state;
(2) the individual submits to the jurisdiction of this state by consent in a record, by
entering a general appearance, or by filing a responsive document having the effect
of waiving any contest to personal jurisdiction;
(3) the individual resided with the child in this state;
(4) the individual resided in this state and provided prenatal expenses or support for
the child;
(5) the child resides in this state as a result of the acts or directives of the individual;
(6) the individual engaged in sexual intercourse in this state and the child may have
been conceived by that act of intercourse;
(7) the individual asserted parentage of a child in the Putative Father Registry
maintained in this state by the Department of Health; or
38(8) there is any other basis consistent with the constitutions of this state and the
United States for the exercise of personal jurisdiction.
The bases of personal jurisdiction above may not be used to acquire personal
jurisdiction to modify a child support order of another state unless the requirements
of § 9-17-611 or § 9-17-615 are met.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-201.
Tompkins v. Tompkins, 2020 Ark. App. 122 (Circuit court had subject matter jurisdiction to
establish child support for parties' son, who was long-time resident of Germany and who
lived with mother, upon mother's request as part of divorce proceedings; state statute
authorized circuit court to issue support orders binding on obligor over whom court has
personal jurisdiction when person requesting support order is outside state and no other
support order exists, circuit court had personal jurisdiction over father for child-support
purposes, and no child support order in other forum existed.) See also Ark. Code Ann. §§ 9-
14-105(b)(1), 9-17-401.
Establishment of Support Order
If a support order has not been issued, a responding tribunal of this state with personal
jurisdiction over the parties may issue a support order if:
(1) the individual seeking the order resides outside this state; or
(2) the support enforcement agency seeking the order is located outside this state.
The tribunal may issue a temporary child support order if the tribunal determines that such
an order is appropriate and the individual ordered to pay is:
(1) a presumed father of the child;
(2) petitioning to have his paternity adjudicated;
(3) identified as the father of the child through genetic testing;
(4) an alleged father who has declined to submit to genetic testing;
(5) shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the father of the child;
(6) an acknowledged father as provided by § 9-10-120;
(7) the mother of the child; or
(8) an individual who has been ordered to pay child support in a previous
proceeding and the order has not been reversed or vacated.
(c) Upon finding, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that an obligor owes a duty of
support, the tribunal shall issue a support order directed to the obligor and may issue other
orders pursuant to § 9-17-305.
39Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-401.
Continuing, Exclusive Jurisdiction
The court that issues a support order shall have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify
and enforce its order.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-202
A tribunal of this state that has issued a child-support order consistent with the law of this
state has and shall exercise continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify its child-support
order if the order is the controlling order and:
(1) at the time of the filing of a request for modification this state is the residence of the
obligor, the individual obligee, or the child for whose benefit the support order is issued; or
(2) even if this state is not the residence of the obligor, the individual obligee, or the child
for whose benefit the support order is issued, the parties consent in a record or in open
court that the tribunal of this state may continue to exercise jurisdiction to modify its order.
A tribunal of this state that has issued a child-support order consistent with the law of this
state may not exercise continuing, exclusive jurisdiction to modify the order if:
(1) all of the parties who are individuals file consent in a record with the tribunal of this
state that a tribunal of another state that has jurisdiction over at least one of the parties
who is an individual or that is located in the state of residence of the child may modify the
order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction; or
(2) its order is not the controlling order.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-205
Continuing, exclusive jurisdiction also applies to spousal-support order pursuant to 9-17-
211.
Determination of Controlling Order under UIFSA
If a proceeding is brought under this chapter and only one tribunal has issued a child
support order, the order of that tribunal controls and must be so recognized. If a proceeding
is brought under this chapter, and two or more child support orders have been issued by
differing states, then you should look at
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-207 to determine the controlling order.
40Provisions of UIFSA
Except where otherwise noted, a responding tribunal of this state shall apply Arkansas
procedural and substantive law. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-303.
The respective duties of the initiating and responding tribunals are set out in Ark. Code Ann.
§ 9-17-304 & 305.
Responding tribunal should not address collateral matters such as visitation or setoff.
See Chaisson v. Ragsdale, 323 Ark. 373, 914 S.W.2d 739 (1996)(actions under UIFSA
are not intended to open for renewed scrutiny all issues arising out of foreign
divorce but purpose of UIFSA is support of child and enforcement of same and other
issues, such as visitation and payment of debts under divorce decree, are collateral
matters that burden child support determinations and run counter to Act's goal of
streamlining proceedings).
See also Office of Child Support Enforcement v. Clemmons, 65 Ark. App. 84, 984
S.W.2d 837 (1999)(mother's failure to allow father visitation with child was a
collateral matter that trial court should not have considered in determining whether
father owed child support arrearages).
If a petition or comparable pleading is received by an inappropriate tribunal of this state, the
tribunal shall forward the pleading and accompanying documents to an appropriate tribunal
of this state or another state and notify the petitioner where and when the pleading was
sent. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-306.
If a party alleges in an affidavit or a pleading under oath that the health, safety, or liberty of
a party or child would be jeopardized by disclosure of specific identifying information, that
information must be sealed and may not be disclosed to the other party or the public. After
a hearing in which a tribunal takes into consideration the health, safety, or liberty of the
party or child, the tribunal may order disclosure of information that the tribunal determines
to be in the interest of justice. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-312.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-313 provides for certain fees and costs to be assessed, except that
OCSE or a contract entity shall not be charged fees or costs for actions brought under UIFSA.
Nonparentage is not a defense where that issue has been previously litigated. Ark. Code
Ann. § 9-17-315.
Ark. Code Ann. §§ 9-17-316, 317, & 318 provide for certain special rules of evidence and
procedure, communication between tribunals, and assistance with discovery.
Terms of Withholding Order
41The employer shall withhold and distribute the funds as directed in the withholding order by
complying with terms of the order which specify:
(1) the duration and amount of periodic payments of current child support, stated
as a sum certain;
(2) the person designated to receive payments and the address to which the
payments are to be forwarded;
(3) medical support, whether in the form of periodic cash payment, stated as a sum
certain, or ordering the obligor to provide health insurance coverage for the child
under a policy available through the obligor's employment;
(4) the amount of periodic payments of fees and costs for a support enforcement
agency, the issuing tribunal, and the obligee's attorney, stated as sums certain; and
(5) the amount of periodic payments of arrearages and interest on arrearages,
stated as sums certain.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-502.
Direct Enforcement of Another State’s Order
An income-withholding order issued in another state may be sent by or on behalf of the
oblige, or by the support enforcement agency, to the person defined as the obligor's
employer under the income-withholding law of this state without first filing a petition or
comparable pleading or registering the order with a tribunal of this state. Ark. Code Ann. §
9-17-501.
An obligor may contest the validity or enforcement of an income-withholding order issued
in another state and received directly by an employer in this state by registering the order in
a tribunal of this state and filing a contest to that order in the same manner as if the order
had been issued by a tribunal of this state. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-506.
An employer that willfully fails to comply with an income-withholding order issued by
another state and received for enforcement is subject to the same penalties that may be
imposed for noncompliance with an order issued by a tribunal of this state. Ark. Code Ann. §
9-17-505.
Enforcement and Modification after Registration
A support order or an income-withholding order issued in another state or a foreign support
order may be registered in this state for enforcement. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-601.
The procedures for registration are found in Ark. Code Ann. §§ 9-17-602 & 603.
42The law of the issuing state or foreign country governs (1) the nature, extent, amount, and
duration of current payments under a registered support order; (2) the computation and
payment of arrearages and accrual of interest on the arrearages under the support order;
and (3) the existence and satisfaction of other obligations under the support order.
In a proceeding for arrears under a registered support order, the statute of
limitation of this state or of the issuing state or foreign country, whichever is longer,
applies.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-604.
See Clemmons v. Office of Child Support Enforcement, 72 Ark. App. 443, 37 S.W.3d
687 (2001)(where California statute of limitations applied).
A hearing to contest the validity or enforcement of the registered order must be requested
within twenty (20) days after notice. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-605. Procedure for notice and
contest found in Ark. Code Ann. § 9-17-605, 606.
A party contesting the validity or enforcement of a registered order or seeking to vacate the
registration has the burden of proving one (1) or more of the defenses in Ark. Code Ann. § 9-
17-607.
Statutory procedures by which obligor under foreign child support order must
request hearing to contest validity of order within 20 days of notice of its
registration in state do not contravene federal due process guarantees. State of
Wash. v. Thompson, 339 Ark. 417, 6 S.W.3d 82 (1999).
See also Office of Child Support Enforcement v. Cook, 60 Ark. App. 193, 959 S.W.2d
763 (1998)(chancery court did not have authority to modify out-of-state child
support order entered at divorce, in action to register order under UIFSA, where
mother and child were nonresidents and did not consent to jurisdiction of chancery
court. Divorced father could not seek modification of out-of-state child support
order in state, but rather had to apply to issuing tribunal, even though his support
obligation exceeded his income, where he failed to appeal from child support order
and failed to appeal from finding in present case that child support order would be
given full faith and credit.)
Ark. Code Ann. §§ 9-17-609 - 612 set out provisions for modifying an order from another
state and for recognizing an order modified by another state which was originally issued by
this state.
See Jefferson Cnty. Child Support Enforcement Unit v. Hollands, 327 Ark. 456, 939
S.W.2d 302 (1997)( order filed by Arkansas court imposing child support obligation
that differed from obligation originally imposed in Michigan did not change or
modify Michigan child support decree).
43See also Office of Child Support Enforcement v. Neely, 73 Ark. App. 198, 41 S.W.3d
423 (2001)(Arkansas court does not nullify or supersede a sister court's support
decree unless it specifically provides for nullification).
Determination of Parentage
§ 9-17-402: A tribunal of this state authorized to determine parentage of a child may serve
as a responding tribunal in a proceeding to determine parentage of a child brought under
this chapter or a law or procedure substantially similar to this chapter.

X. Child Custody
Award of Custody
Note: significant legislative changes were made in 2021 and caselaw in the section may have been
decided under prior law.
Rebuttable Presumption and Best Interest.
In an action concerning an original child custody determination in a divorce or paternity
matter, there is a rebuttable presumption that joint custody is in the best interest of the
child.
The presumption that joint custody is in the best interest of the child may be
rebutted:
(1) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that joint custody is
not in the best interest of the child;
(2) If the parties have reached an agreement on all issues related to custody
of the child;
(3) If one (1) of the parties does not request sole, primary, or joint custody;
or
(4) If a rebuttable presumption described in subsection (c) or subsection (d)
of this section is established by the evidence (Note: see domestic violence and sex
offenders section on following page).
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(a)(1)(A)(iv).
After a hearing on the merits of a child custody action, if a court determines that the
presumption in subdivision (a)(1)(A)(iv)(a) of this section is rebutted, the court shall enter a
written order that includes the following:
(A) Facts, findings, and conclusions of law concerning the basis for the court's
determination; and
44(B) A parenting time schedule that:
(i) Maximizes the amount of time that each parent has with the child; and
(ii) Is consistent with the best interest of the child.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(b)(3)
Joint Custody is Favored in Arkansas
In 2013, the General Assembly amended Arkansas Code Annotated §9-13-101 to announce
that an award of joint custody is favored in Arkansas.
2019 Ark. Acts 906.
In an action for divorce, the award of custody of a child of the marriage shall be made
without regard to the sex of a parent but solely in accordance with the welfare and best
interest of the child.
In determining the best interest of the child, the court may consider the preferences of the
child if the child is of a sufficient age and mental capacity to reason, regardless of
chronological age.
In an action for divorce, an award of joint custody is favored in Arkansas.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(A)(1)(A)(iii)
Record. In any contested case, a verbatim record must be made; no exception is made for
domestic relations cases. Administrative Order No. 4; Ark. Code Ann. § 16-13-510.
See McNair v. Johnson, 75 Ark. App. 261, 57 S.W.3d 742 (2001)(testimony of
children in a child custody proceeding had to be unsealed in order for father to
make a record on appeal that contained evidence relevant to his contention that the
evidence was insufficient to support change of custody to mother and to make
required abstract of that evidence).
See also Mattocks v. Mattocks, 66 Ark. App. 77, 986 S.W.2d 890 (1999)(chancery
court's failure to make record of in camera hearing with minor children required
remand).
The circuit court shall require the official court reporter to make a verbatim record of all
proceedings, pertaining to any matter before the court or the jury, regardless of whether
these proceedings occur in-person, in court, or in chambers; telephonically; or through
video-conference. This may be waived by the parties in all matters except criminal cases.
Circuit Courts are courts of records and waivers are discouraged in most circumstances. The
verbatim record shall include a transcription of all spoken words from any source including
but not limited to: colloquies between the court and counsel and self-represented litigants;
arguments; objections; testimony; jury instructions; communications between the court and
members of the jury; discussions concerning juror notes; and audio contained in videos or
45other recordings that are presented to the court or jury, whether in open court or in
camera.
Administrative Order No. 4.
Both Parents. When in the best interest of a child, custody shall be awarded in such a way
so as to assure the frequent and continuing contact of the child with both parents. Ark. Code
Ann. § 9-13-101.
A parent who is not granted sole, primary, or joint custody of his or her child is entitled to
reasonable parenting time with the child unless the court finds after a hearing that
parenting time between the parent and the child would seriously endanger the physical,
mental, or emotional health of the child.
At the request of a party, a court shall issue a written order that:
(1) Is specific as to the frequency, timing, duration, condition, and method of
scheduling parenting time with a parent who is not granted sole, primary, or joint custody of
his or her child; and
(2) Takes into consideration the developmental age of the child.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(b)(1)(A)(vii)
Domestic Violence.
If a party to an action concerning custody of or a right to visitation with a child has
committed an act of domestic violence against the party making the allegation or a family or
household member of either party and such allegations are proven by a preponderance of
the evidence, the circuit court must consider the effect of such domestic violence upon the
best interests of the child, whether or not the child was physically injured or personally
witnessed the abuse, together with such facts and circumstances as the circuit court deems
relevant in making a direction pursuant to this section.
There is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of the child to be
placed in the custody of an abusive parent in cases in which there is a finding by a
preponderance of the evidence that the parent has engaged in a pattern of
domestic abuse.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(c).
Sex Offenders. If a party to an action concerning custody of or a right to visitation with a
child is a sex offender who is required to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act,
the circuit court may not award custody or unsupervised visitation of the child to the sex
offender unless the circuit court makes a specific finding that the sex offender poses no
danger to the child.
46There is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of the child to be
placed in the care or custody of a sex offender or to have unsupervised visitation
with a sex offender.
There is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of the child to be
placed in the home of a sex offender or to have unsupervised visitation in a home in
which a sex offender resides.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(d).
Tender Years Doctrine Abolished. In an action for divorce, the award of custody of a child of
the marriage shall be made without regard to the sex of a parent but solely in accordance
with the welfare and best interest of the child. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(a).
The presumption that the mother could best care for a young child (the "tender years"
doctrine) was abolished in 1987.
By enacting § 9–13–101, the legislature intended to abolish any gender-based legal
preference in child custody determinations, and thus court should not apply tender
years doctrine. Riddle v. Riddle, 28 Ark. App. 344, 775 S.W.2d 513 (1989).
Natural Parent Preference.
“Without a finding of parental unfitness, our courts have never abrogated the custody rights
of a biological parent.” Priesmeyer v. Huggis, 2021 Ark. App. 410 (2021).
Stepparent can be awarded custody of minor child; however, there is preference for natural
parent in custody matters, and preference must prevail unless it is established that natural
parent is unfit. Stamps v. Rawlins, 297 Ark. 370, 761 S.W.2d 933 (1988)(custody of five-year-
old child should have been left with natural mother, rather than stepfather, in light of
chancellor's finding that mother was fit and proper person for custody).
See also Freeman v. Freeman, 360 Ark. 445 (wherein court rejected argument that “the
natural-parent preference must prevail unless it is established that the natural parent is
unfit,” observing that Stamps is a modification-of-custody case which is governed by the
case-law preference, not a guardianship case like Freeman which has a statutory preference
found in Ark. Code Ann. § 28–65–204(a).” The Court took this opportunity to clarify that the
sole considerations in determining guardianship pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. § 28–65–204(a)
are whether the natural parent is qualified and suitable and what is in the child's best
interest.)
Sory v. Woodall, 73 Ark. App. 344, 43 S.W.3d 765 (2001)(although there is a preference to
award custody of a child to a biological parent, this preference is not absolute; in this case, it
was in the children’s best interests to be in the custody of their grandmother).
47See also Golden v. Golden, 57 Ark. App. 143, 942 S.W.2d 282 (1997).
For time limit on requesting stepparent visitation, see Blackwood v. Floyd, 342 Ark. 498.
Caselaw.
While there exists a preference for the natural parent to have custody over all
others, the paramount consideration is at all times the best interest of the child,
which can overcome the parental preference when a child is left in the care of a
non-parent for a substantial period of time. Coffee v. Zolliecoffer, 93 Ark. App. 61,
216 S.W.3d 636 (2005).
The rights of parents are not proprietary and are subject to their related duty to
care for and protect the child; the law secures their preferential rights only as long
as they discharge their obligations. Dunham v. Doyle, 84 Ark. App. 36, 129 S.W.3d
304 (2003).
While there is a preference in child custody cases to award a child to its biological
parent, that preference is not absolute; rather, of prime concern, and the
controlling factor, is the best interest of the child. Freshour v. West, 334 Ark. 100,
971 S.W.2d 263 (1998).
Also see 9-13-101(a)(2) for grandparent visitation rights and notice requirements in
custody case.
Fault. Fault in the divorce is not the determining factor in awarding custody since an award
of custody is neither a reward nor a punishment for a parent. The children's welfare is the
controlling consideration. Burns v. Burns, 312 Ark. 61, 847 S.W.2d 23 (1993).
Criminal Records. Any parent of a minor child in a circuit court case may petition the court
to order a criminal records check of the other parent of the minor child or other adult
members of the household eighteen (18) years of age or older who reside with the parent
for custody and visitation determination purposes. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-105.
Drug Test. In a proceeding concerning a child, the court may order drug testing of a party
upon application of a party or by its own motion. Ark. Code Ann. 9-13-109.
Best Interest Factors
A court shall consider the best interest of the child when making a child custody
determination. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101
In determining the best interest of the child, the court may consider the preferences of the
child if the child is of a sufficient age and mental capacity to reason, regardless of
chronological age. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101.
48The primary consideration in awarding custody of children is the welfare and best interests
of the children involved; all other considerations are secondary. Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, 63
Ark. App. 254, 976 S.W.2d 956 (1998).
Factors the court may consider in determining what is in best interest of child include the
psychological relationship between the parents and the child, the need for stability and
continuity in child's relationship with the parents and siblings, the past conduct of the
parents toward the child, and the reasonable preference of child. Rector v. Rector, 58 Ark.
App. 132, 947 S.W.2d 389 (1997).
Father was granted custody after testifying regarding the actions he took with respect to the
care of the children, his relationship with them, their relationship with their extended
family, his educational concerns, his parenting philosophy; the trial court also had before it
evidence of the parties' relationship with each other and their ability to interact with each
other with respect to the children and visitation issues, as well as considered the children's
stated preference as to their living arrangements before reaching its best-interest
determination. Emis v. Emis, 2017 Ark. App. 372.
Modification of Custody Order
A judicial award of custody should not be modified unless it is shown that there are changed
conditions that demonstrate that a modification of the decree is in the best interest of the
child, or when there is a showing of facts affecting the best interest of the child that were
either not presented to the chancellor or were not known by the chancellor at the time the
original custody order was entered. Campbell v. Campbell,336 Ark. 379, 985 S.W.2d 724
(1999). Generally, courts impose more stringent standards for modifications in custody than
they do for initial determinations of custody.
See Hamilton v. Barrett, 337 Ark. 460, 466, 989 S.W.2d 520, 523 (1999)(evidence of former
wife's violation of custody and settlement agreement by having male guests overnight when
children were present, former wife's remarriage, and birth of child to former husband and
his new wife, demonstrated material changes in parties' circumstances arising since prior
order of custody in divorce decree and justifying award of custody of parties' children to
former husband).
The burden of proving such a change is on the party seeking the modification. There must
be proof of material facts which were unknown to the court at that time, or proof that the
conditions have so materially changed as to warrant modification and that the best interest
of the child requires it. See Carver v. May, 81 Ark. App. 292, 101 S.W.3d 256 (2003)(mother's
actions in alienating children from father and interfering with visitation detrimentally
impacted children's well being such that best interests of the children required that custody
be changed from mother to father, where mother repeatedly interfered with visitation,
mother instigated a fruitless sexual-abuse investigation, children were subjected to medical
49examination for sexual abuse, and mother obtained a protective order to prohibit father
from seeing children).
To facilitate stability and continuity in the life of a child and to discourage repeated litigation
of the same issues, custody can be modified only upon a showing of a material change of
circumstances. Stills v. Stills, 2010 Ark. 132, 361 S.W.3d 823.
Vo v. Vo, 78 Ark. App. 134, 79 S.W.3d 388 (2002)(former wife's request to relocate from
Arkansas to California was not a material change of circumstances that warranted
modification of child custody).
A party cannot use the circumstances he created as grounds to modify custody. Brown v.
Brown,2012 Ark. 89, 398 S.W.3d 159 (2012). And see Davenport v. Uselton, 2013 Ark. App.
344 (holding that the father failed to prove a material change in circumstances to support
his petition when he was the one who relocated, and a party should not be permitted to
allege a material change of circumstances that he himself has created; father's relocation,
his developing relationship with the child, and the change in his work schedule
were circumstances attributable to him and were insufficient, standing alone, to support
a material change in circumstances. Moreover, as found by the trial court, there were
no changes with the mother's situation that would constitute
a material change of circumstances.)
Relocation as a Factor in Custody
Relocation of a custodial parent and children is not, by itself, a material change in
circumstance justifying a change in custody.
A presumption exists in favor of relocation for custodial parents with primary custody, with
the burden to rebut the presumption on the noncustodial parent.
A custodial parent in Arkansas no longer has to prove a real advantage to himself or herself
and the children in relocating.
Although polestar in making a relocation determination is the best interest of the child, the
court should take into consideration the following matters:
(1) the reason for the relocation;
(2) the educational, health, and leisure opportunities available in the location in
which the custodial parent and children will relocate;
(3) visitation and communication schedule for the noncustodial parent;
(4) the effect of the move on the extended family relationships in the location in
which the custodial parent and children will relocate, as well as Arkansas; and,
50(5) preference of the child, including the age, maturity, and the reasons given by the
child as to his or her preference.
Hollandsworth v. Knyzewski, 353 Ark. 470, 109 S.W.3d 653 (2003). In Hollandsworth, the
Arkansas Supreme Court announced a presumption in favor of relocation for parents with
primary custody. The court held that the noncustodial parent should have the burden to
rebut the relocation presumption. Therefore, the custodial parent no longer has the
obligation to prove a real advantage to parent and child when relocating.
For application of the factors, see Benedix v. Romeo, 94 Ark. App. 412 (2006); Sill v. Sill, 94
Ark. App. 211 (2006); Hurtt v. Hurtt, 93 Ark. App. 37 (2005).
However, see Singletary v. Singletary, 2013 Ark. 506, for analysis of relocation in joint
custody case, wherein a parent is not entitled to the Hollandsworth favorable presumption
when they share joint custody. Singletary clarified that the proper analysis for a court facing
a change-in-custody request due to relocation of one parent when the parents have joint
custody is essentially the same as a change-in-custody analysis when relocation is not
involved.
Also see Cooper v. Kalkwarf, 2017 Ark. 331, 532 S.W.3d 58 (2017). “The
Hollandsworth presumption should be applied only when the parent seeking to relocate is
not just labeled the “primary” custodian in the divorce decree but also spends significantly
more time with the child than the other parent. This standard preserves the rights of a
primary custodian when he or she has shouldered the vast majority of the responsibility of
caring for and making decisions on behalf of the child, and it also more accurately reflects
the best interest of the child, which is the polestar consideration in any custody
decision. Joint-custody arrangements cannot be defined with mathematical
precision. See Ark. Code Ann. § 9–13–101(a)(5) (defining joint custody as the “approximate
and reasonable equal division of time with the child by both parents....”. Thus, we do not
attempt to oversimplify the issue of relocation by imposing an arbitrary percentage of time
that a parent must spend with the child for the Singletary analysis to apply. Rather, by this
opinion, we seek to recognize the realities of modern parenting and to emphasize that a
joint-custody arrangement does not necessarily involve a precise “50/50” division of time.
We further note that parental influence and commitment, involvement in the child's daily
activities, and responsibility for making decisions on behalf of the child are important factors
in the circuit court's consideration of the relocation issue. By limiting
the Hollandsworth presumption to those situations where the child spends significantly less
time with the alternate parent, the disruptive impact that a relocation would have on that
relationship is minimized.”
Conflict/Lack of Cooperation of Parties and Joint Custody Considerations:
The circuit court may enter an order to reduce areas of conflict in a manner determined appropriate
by the court.
51If, at any time, the circuit court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that one (1) parent
demonstrates a pattern of willfully creating conflict in an attempt to disrupt a current or pending joint-
custody arrangement and the circuit court is unable to enter an order that will reduce areas of conflict
caused by the disruptive parent, the circuit court may deem such behavior as a material change of
circumstances and may change a joint custody order to an order of primary custody to the nondisruptive
parent.
Ark. Code Ann. 9-13-101
Cases before 2021 Legislation:
Pace v. Pace, 2020 Ark. 108 (2020)(The General Assembly amended Arkansas Code
Annotated section 9-13-101 to announce that an award of joint custody is “favored” in Arkansas.
Previously, case law held that joint custody was not favored unless circumstances clearly warrant
such action. This change in the law is profound; the parties were no longer obligated to maintain a
careful balance of cooperation to stave off a judicial dissolution of a joint-custody arrangement.)
Szwedo v. Cyrus, 2020 Ark. App. 319 (2020)(The Pace court noted that in 2013, the General
Assembly amended Arkansas Code Annotated section 9-13-101 to announce that an award of joint
custody is now “favored” in Arkansas. The court called this change in the law
“profound.” Although Pace involved a modification where joint custody had already been ordered,
its rationale supports the circuit court's award of joint custody in this case.)
Hoover v. Hoover, 2016 Ark. App. 322, 498 S.W.3d 297 (2016)(Although the record
demonstrates that there is a significant level of animosity between these parties, the record also
shows that both parties are capable parents who love their children and are equally involved with
their activities. The attorney ad litem stated on the record that all three children expressed the
desire to spend significantly more time with their father, and a joint shared physical custody
arrangement accommodates those wishes. The appellate court affirmed the circuit court’s award of
joint custody.)
Attorney’s Fees
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-309(a), which authorizes award of attorneys’ fees in divorce actions,
is construed to permit fees in child custody modifications. Finkbeiner v. Finkbeiner, 226 Ark.
165, 288 (1956).
The court has inherent authority to award attorneys’ fees in custody modification cases.
Jones v. Jones, 327 Ark. 195, 938 S.W.2d 228 (1997).
The courts’ authority to award attorneys’ fees applies to contempt proceedings arising from
custody cases as well.
Payne v. White, 1 Ark. App. 271, 614 S.W.2d 684 (1981)(trial court had inherent
power to allow attorney fees in proceeding for contempt brought against mother
for violation of custody decree by secreting child outside jurisdiction of court,
52notwithstanding statute which appears to limit award of attorney fees to actions to
enforce payment of alimony, maintenance and support).
Transfer of Custody on School Property
The transfer of a child from a custodial parent to a noncustodial parent is prohibited on the
real property of a public school on normal school days during school hours.
This does not prevent one parent from taking a child to school and the other parent from
picking the child up.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-104.
Attorneys Ad Litem

XI. Visitation
Both Parents.
When in the best interest of a child, custody shall be awarded in such a way so as to assure the
frequent and continuing contact of the child with both parents. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101.
A parent who is not granted sole, primary, or joint custody of his or her child is entitled to
reasonable parenting time with the child unless the court finds after a hearing that
parenting time between the parent and the child would seriously endanger the physical,
mental, or emotional health of the child.
At the request of a party, a court shall issue a written order that:
(1) Is specific as to the frequency, timing, duration, condition, and method of
scheduling parenting time with a parent who is not granted sole, primary, or joint custody of
his or her child; and
(2) Takes into consideration the developmental age of the child.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(b)(1)(A)(vii)
See “Custody” section for rebuttable presumption of joint custody.
Modification of Visitation
The test for determining whether modification is warranted based on whether a material
change in circumstances has occurred is the same regardless of whether it is
a visitation case or a child-custody case. See Brown v. Brown, 2012 Ark. 89.
See, Lewellyn v. Lewellyn, 351 Ark. 346, 93 S.W.3d 681 (2002) (stating that before the circuit
court can order a modification of custody, it must first determine that a material change in
53circumstances has transpired from the time of the divorce decree and, then, determine that
a modification of custody is in the best interest of the child).
Grandparent Visitation
A grandparent or great-grandparent may petition a circuit court of this state for
reasonable visitation rights with respect to his or her grandchild or grandchildren or great-
grandchild or great-grandchildren under this section if…
See Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-103.
Case Law
A grandparent's right to visit a grandchild is a right created by statute. Painter v. Kerr, 2009
Ark. App. 580, 336 S.W.3d 425 (2009)( grandparents failed to overcome presumption that
mother's decision denying or limiting visitation was in best interest of child, and
grandparents failed to prove by preponderance of evidence that loss of their relationship
with child was likely to harm her).
In re Adoption of J.P., 2011 Ark. 535, 385 S.W.3d 266 (2011)(to prove visitation with
maternal grandmother and great-grandmother was in child's best interest, as required to
rebut presumption that father's decision limiting visitation was in child's best interest,
grandmother and great-grandmother were required to prove, by preponderance of the
evidence, that: (1) they had the capacity to give child love, affection, and guidance; (2) loss
of the relationship between them and child was likely to harm child; and (3) they were
willing to cooperate with father if visitation with child was allowed);
Harrison v. Phillips, 2012 Ark. App. 474 (2012)(evidence was sufficient to show that paternal
grandparents established a significant and viable relationship with grandson, for purposes of
the grandparents visitation statute, in action by grandparents seeking visitation; mother
acknowledged that early in child's life there may have been 12 consecutive months of
regular and frequent contact between the child and his grandparents, while the parents
were still married; however, evidence was insufficient to show that the loss of the
relationship between paternal grandparents and grandson was likely to harm him); and
Hollingsworth v. Hollingsworth, 2010 Ark. App. 101, 377 S.W.3d 313 (2010)(paternal
grandfather was not entitled to order establishing grandparent visitation rights, since
mother had not denied, but only limited, grandfather's visitation with child; grandfather
continued to exercise meaningful visitation and interaction with the child, seeing child on
occasions at school and at extracurricular activities such as ball games, and mother testified
that she intended to continue to permit visitation and would try to accommodate
grandfather's visitation requests).
In Loco Parentis Visitation
54A circuit court may award visitation to a stepparent standing in loco parentis over the
natural parent's objection. Robinson v. Ford-Robinson, 362 Ark. 232, 208 S.W.3d 140
(2005)(ex-wife stood in loco parentis to stepson, and thus was entitled to visitation with
stepson; ex-wife was the only mother stepson had even known, stepson did not know that
ex-wife was not his biological mother until he was in first grade, stepson called ex-wife
“Mommy,” and ex-wife described herself as stepson's mother). Also, see McKenzie v.
Moore, 2015 Ark. App. 6453 S.W.3d 686, wherein the appellate court upheld finding of in
loco parentis.
In loco parentis is defined as “in place of a parent; instead of a parent; charged factitiously
with a parent's rights, duties, and responsibilities.” A person who stands in loco parentis to a
child puts himself or herself in the situation of a lawful parent by assuming the obligations
incident to the parental relation without going through the formalities necessary to a legal
adoption. This relationship involves more than a duty to aid and assist, and more than a
feeling of kindness, affection, or generosity. One's mere status as a stepparent does not
support a finding of in loco parentis. A stepparent who furnishes necessities for a minor
child of his or her spouse and who exercises some control over the child does not, by those
acts alone, establish a parental relationship. In making a determination as to whether a
nonparent stands in loco parentis, courts consider the totality of the circumstances and do
not lightly infer the intent of the person seeking to be considered as standing in loco
parentis. While the length of time a person spends with a child is not determinative, it is a
significant factor in considering whether that person intended to assume parental
obligations or has performed parental duties. Daniel v. Spivey, 2012 Ark. 39, 386 S.W.3d
424, 428 (2012).
See McKenzie v. Moore, 2015 Ark. App. 6 (circuit court's finding that stepmother stood in
loco parentis to child, so as to support award of visitation rights to stepmother after father
died, was not clearly erroneous; father had full custody of child before he died, stepmother
took care of child during the years that she dated father before they were married, child
lived with father and stepmother as a family unit after father and stepmother married, and
child testified that she considered stepmother as family and a parent figure.)
Bethany v. Jones, 2011 Ark. 67, 378 S.W.3d 731 (2011)(circuit court did not clearly err in
finding that biological mother's former same sex partner stood in loco parentis to the child
for visitation purposes; former partner was the stay-at-home mom for over three years who
took care of child, child called partner mommy, child thought of partner's parents as her
grandparents and spent holidays with partner's family, and intentions of mother and
partner were always to co-parent until mother unilaterally determined she no longer
wanted to allow partner to have visitation);
Daniel v. Spivey, 2012 Ark. 39, 386 S.W.3d 424 (2012), reh'g denied (Mar. 15,
2012)(stepfather did not stand in loco parentis to mother's child from previous marriage,
and thus trial court could not award stepfather visitation rights with child as part of divorce
55decree, even though stepfather had been part of child's life for five of child's seven years,
relationship between them was like that of parent and child, stepfather and child engaged in
recreational activities together, and stepfather disciplined child when necessary and praised
her when justified; stepfather's actions demonstrated that he assumed the role of a caring
stepparent, but not that he embraced the rights, duties, and responsibilities of a parent);
and
Blackwood v. Floyd, 342 Ark. 498, 29 S.W.3d 694 (2000)(stepmother did not request
visitation with stepson at divorce hearing and did not claim in loco parentis; child was not
mentioned in divorce proceeding; therefore, no jurisdiction to modify decree more than 90
days after entry).
Sibling Visitation Rights
A brother or sister, regardless of the degree of blood relationship, may petition the Court to
grant reasonable visitation rights when their parents have denied such access.
The circuit courts may issue any further order that may be necessary to enforce the
visitation rights.
Ark. Code Ann. 9-13-102.
Domestic Violence & Sex Offenders
If a party to an action concerning a right to visitation with a child has committed an act of
domestic violence against the party making the allegation or a family or household member
of either party and such allegations are proven by a preponderance of the evidence, the
circuit court must consider the effect of such domestic violence upon the best interests of
the child, whether or not the child was physically injured or personally witnessed the abuse,
together with such facts and circumstances as the circuit court deems relevant in making a
direction pursuant to this section.
There is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of the child to be
placed in the custody of an abusive parent in cases in which there is a finding by a
preponderance of the evidence that the parent has engaged in a pattern of
domestic abuse.
If a party to an action concerning a right to visitation with a child is a sex offender who is
required to register under the Sex Offender Registration Act, the circuit court may not
award custody or unsupervised visitation of the child to the sex offender unless the circuit
court makes a specific finding that the sex offender poses no danger to the child.
There is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of the child to be
placed in the care or custody of a sex offender or to have unsupervised visitation
with a sex offender.
56There is a rebuttable presumption that it is not in the best interest of the child to be
placed in the home of a sex offender or to have unsupervised visitation in a home in
which a sex offender resides.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101.
XII. Uniform Acts for Custody & Visitation
Uniform Child-Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA)
See Ark. Code Ann. §9-19-101 et seq.
The UCCJEA, codified at Arkansas Code Annotated sections 9-19-101 to-401 (Repl. 2015), provides the
exclusive method for determining the proper state for jurisdictional purposes in child-custody proceedings
that involve other jurisdictions. Harris v. Harris, 2010 Ark. App. 160, 379 S.W.3d 8. The appellate court
reviews rulings under the UCCJEA de novo, although they will not reverse a circuit court's findings of fact
unless they are clearly erroneous. Piccioni v. Piccioni, 2011 Ark. App. 177, 378 S.W.3d 838. A circuit court has
the discretion to decide whether to decline to exercise jurisdiction, and the appellate court will not reverse
the court's decision absent an abuse of discretion. Id., 378 S.W.3d 838.
Note: See the National Conference of Commissions on Uniform State Laws: http://www.uniformlaws.org
which provides the following history and summary:
THE OBJECTIVE OF THE UCCJEA. The UCCJEA, the UCCJA and the PKPA are necessary because
Americans are a mobile people who seldom stay in one state. Child custody disputes between
parents, which arise when there is a divorce or when unmarried biological parents want to have
custody adjudicated in a court, are impacted by that very mobility. When parents and children live
and have lived in one state, the courts of that state may take jurisdiction over any child custody 2
matter without question. But it is common for a parent to live in a different state from the one in
which the other parent and the child live. More than one state may have the power to adjudicate a
dispute between them. If more than one state does exercise its power, the competing decisions
simply confuse, rather than conclude the dispute. Child custody orders also have a quality that
exaggerates the problem. They are modifiable orders, subject to reconsideration and change, until
the children subject to them reach the age of majority. Circumstances may change between the
parties governed by an order, and that may require a court to change the order - to modify it. A
common scenario involves a child custody order issued in a state where the parents and the child
lived together before the parents divorce each other. Then the custodial parent moves with the child
to another state. If there is a need to modify the order, in which state can that modification take
place? And if the second state purports to modify the order from the first state, which order is to be
recognized and enforced in the first state and in every other state in the United States? When there
were no clear answers to these questions, the result was parental kidnapping of children to exploit
the confusion. The UCCJEA, and the UCCJA and the PKPA before it, tries to answer these very
important questions. It answers by establishing clear bases for taking jurisdiction and by providing
rules that discourage competing child custody orders.
HOME STATE PRIORITY. In the UCCJA, there are four principles, or bases, for taking jurisdiction over a
child custody dispute. These are child’s home state; significant connection between state and parties
57to a child custody dispute; emergency jurisdiction when the child is present and the child’s welfare is
threatened; and, presence of the child in the event there is no other state with another sound basis
for taking jurisdiction. (The term “taking jurisdiction” simply means that a state’s courts have a good
reason for summoning the contestants to come before them to adjudicate the dispute no matter
where they reside. If there is jurisdiction, the court’s orders are valid and enforceable.) The original
drafters of the UCCJA always thought that the home state of the child was the best state within
which to find the information for making a custody decision in the best interests of the child. But it
was also assumed that once a court took jurisdiction on any other acceptable basis, that state should
be able to proceed without delaying to determine if some other state has home state status. But the
drafters of the PKPA took the opposite position, regarding “home state” as so significantly better
than any other jurisdictional ground, that it should always be the priority ground. Under the PKPA
the home state always has the first opportunity to take jurisdiction. The UCCJEA now supports the
PKPA position. Any state that is not the “home state” of the child will defer to the “home state,” if
there is one, in taking jurisdiction over a child custody dispute. Temporary emergency jurisdiction
may be taken, but only long enough to secure the safety of the threatened person and to transfer the
proceeding to the home state, or if none, to a state with another ground for jurisdiction.
CONTINUING EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION. The UCCJEA also provides for continuing exclusive
jurisdiction. If a state once takes jurisdiction over a child custody dispute, it retains jurisdiction so
long as that state, by its own determination, maintains a significant connection with the disputants
or until all disputants have moved away from that state. In contrast, the UCCJA allows jurisdiction to
shift if the initial ground for taking jurisdiction ceases to exist. Thus, if a state takes jurisdiction over a
child custody dispute because that state is the home state of the child, and the child subsequently
establishes a new home state, jurisdiction can shift to the new home state, even if one parent 3
remains in the child’s original home state. The UCCJEA would not allow the jurisdiction to shift in this
fashion, keeping it in the original home state so long as the parent remains there. TEMPORARY
EMERGENCY JURISDICTION Under the UCCJA, grounds for taking emergency jurisdiction are on an
equal footing with the other grounds for taking jurisdiction, including the “home state” ground. If the
child is present in a state and there is evidence of abandonment or abuse to or mistreatment of the
child, that state can take jurisdiction under the UCCJA. The UCCJEA provides for temporary
emergency jurisdiction, that can ripen into continuing jurisdiction only if no other state with grounds
for continuing jurisdiction can be found or, if found, declines to take jurisdiction. The child’s presence
and its abandonment, mistreatment or abuse still trigger the taking of emergency jurisdiction, but
threats to siblings or a parent also can trigger the taking of emergency jurisdiction. Because of the
priority given to the home state of the child, the home state will most often be the state from which
continuing jurisdiction is exercised. The impact of these changes in the UCCJEA from the UCCJA is to
reinforce the impact of the PKPA. Priority for home state jurisdiction, continuing exclusive jurisdiction
and temporary emergency jurisdiction mean that orders made pursuant to the UCCJEA will have the
full weight of the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution behind them.
ENFORCEMENT OF CUSTODY AND VISITATION ORDERS. The UCCJEA also adds enforcement
provisions to the jurisdictional provisions. Interstate enforcement of custody and visitation decrees
has proved frustrating to parents and to the courts. The UCCJEA requires a state to enforce a custody
or visitation order from another state that conforms substantially with this Act. An order from a state
that has continuing exclusive jurisdiction, therefore, will surely be enforced. One enforcement
procedure is reminiscent of procedures for enforcement under the Uniform Interstate Family Support
Act for interstate spousal and child support orders and the Uniform Enforcement of Foreign
Judgments Act, which governs the interstate enforcement of any civil judgment. The basic procedure
58is to register the outof-state order. If the registration is not contested, the registered order may be
enforced by any means available to enforce a domestic order. This would ordinarily mean using the
contempt powers of the court to assure that the custody or visitation order is honored by the parent
subject to it. There is an expedited remedy, however, that also is available. Upon receiving a verified
petition, the court orders the party with the child to submit to an immediate hearing (the next
judicial day unless impossible) for enforcement. The court may rule with respect to enforcement at
the hearing, although there are provisions to allow for extended hearing and standards to contest
enforcement. This remedy operates much like habeas corpus, in which the body subject to the writ
must be presented immediately to the court. If there is danger to a child or if it appears that the child
will be removed from the enforcing jurisdiction, a petition may also be filed for a warrant to take
physical custody of the child along with a petition for an expedited proceeding. If the warrant issues,
law enforcement officers will serve the warrant and obtain physical custody of the child. As a last
enforcement device, the UCCJEA gives prosecutors the power to enforce custody or visitation orders,
and law enforcement officers the power to locate a child under instructions from prosecutors. These
powers give 4 parents and others who are the victims (along with children) of parental kidnapping
the ability to seek help from those who enforce the criminal law. The effect is to provide a complete
group of effective remedies.
This article points out the impact of major provisions. Here are the Arkansas citations:
Proceedings Governed by Other Law
“Child-custody proceeding” is defined as a proceeding in which legal custody, physical custody, or visitation
with respect to a child is an issue. The term includes a proceeding for divorce, separation, neglect, abuse,
dependency, guardianship, paternity, termination of parental rights, and protection from domestic violence,
in which the issue may appear. The term does not include a proceeding involving juvenile delinquency,
contractual emancipation, or enforcement under subchapter 3 of this chapter (subchapter relates to the
Hague Convention on the Civil Aspects of International Child Abduction or enforcement of a child-custody
determination).
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-102.
The UCCJEA does not govern adoption proceedings or proceedings pertaining to the authorization of
emergency medical care for a child.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-103.
The UCCJEA applies to interstate custody disputes only, not to intrastate custody matters.
Abeyta . Abeyta, 2013 Ark. App. 726; Seamans. v. Seamans, 73 Ark. App. 27 (2001)(UCCJEA does not
apply to purely intrastate custody disputes; court has no authority to award attorney fees under the Act).
Application of UCCJEA to Indian Tribes
A child-custody proceeding that pertains to an Indian child as defined in the Indian Child Welfare Act, 25
U.S.C., 25 § 1901 et seq., is not subject to the UCCJEA to the extent that it is governed by the Indian Child
59Welfare Act. A tribe shall be treated as if it were a state for the purposes of applying subchapters 1 and 2 of
this chapter.
A child-custody determination made by a tribe under factual circumstances in substantial conformity with
the jurisdictional standards of this chapter must be recognized and enforced under subchapter 3 of this
chapter.
Ark. Code Ann. §9-19-104.
Effect of Child-Custody Determination
A child-custody determination made by a court of this state that had jurisdiction under the UCCJEA binds all
persons who have been served in accordance with Arkansas law or in accordance with the law of the state in
which service was made. Persons are also bound who have submitted to the jurisdiction of the court and
who have been given an opportunity to be heard.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-106.
Priority
Upon the request of a party, questions that arise in child-custody proceedings regarding the existence or
exercise of jurisdiction under the UCCJEA must be given priority on the calendar and handled expeditiously.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-107.
Appearance and Limited Immunity
A party to a child-custody proceeding is not subject to personal jurisdiction in Arkansas for another
proceeding or purpose solely for being physically present in the state to participate in that proceeding.
One subject to personal jurisdiction in Arkansas on some basis other than physical presence is not immune
from service of process here.
The immunity granted for purposes of a child-custody proceeding is not immune to civil litigation based on
acts unrelated to the child-custody proceeding that an individual commits while in Arkansas.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-109.
Communication Between Courts
Arkansas courts may communicate with a court in another state concerning a proceeding arising under the
UCCJEA.
The court may allow the parties to participate in the communication. If they are not able to participate, they
must have the opportunity to present facts and legal arguments before a decision on jurisdiction is made.
60Courts may communicate on schedules, calendars, records, and similar matters without informing the
parties, and no record need be made of the communications. Otherwise, a record must be made of a
communication and the parties must be informed and granted access to the record. For these purposes,
“record” means information inscribed on a tangible medium or stored electronically or in another
retrievable medium.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-110.
Taking Testimony in Another State
A party to a child-custody proceeding may offer testimony of witnesses who are in another state, by
deposition or other means allowable in Arkansas. The court on its own motion may order that testimony of
a person be taken in another state and may prescribe the manner and terms upon which the testimony is
taken.
An Arkansas court may permit a person in another state to be deposed or to testify by telephone,
audiovisual, or other electronic means before a designated court or at another location in that state. An
Arkansas court shall cooperate with courts of other states in designating an appropriate location for the
deposition or testimony.
Documentary evidence transmitted from another state to an Arkansas court by technological means that do
not produce an original writing may not be excluded from evidence on an objection based on the means of
transmission.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-111.
Cooperation Between Courts
An Arkansas court may request a court of another state to:
Hold an evidentiary hearing;
Order a person to produce or give evidence pursuant to that state’s procedures;
Order a custody evaluation be made of a child involved in the proceeding;
Forward to the Arkansas court a certified copy of the transcript of the hearing, evidence presented, or the
requested evaluation; and
Order a party to the proceeding or anyone having physical custody of the child to appear in the proceeding
with or without the child.
A court of another state may request an Arkansas court to hold such a hearing or to enter an order as
described above.
Travel and other necessary and reasonable expenses for the above may be assessed against the parties in
accordance with Arkansas law.
Pleadings, orders, decrees, records of hearings, evaluations, and other pertinent records with respect to a
child-custody proceeding shall be preserved until the child is 18 years old. If a court or law enforcement
official of another state requests it, the Arkansas court shall forward a certified copy of the records.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-112.
Child-Custody Jurisdiction under the UCCJEA
61Initial Child Custody Jurisdiction
Except as provided in § 9-19-204, an Arkansas court has jurisdiction to make an initial child-custody
determination only if:
Arkansas is the home state of the child on the date of the commencement of the proceeding; or
Arkansas was the home state of the child within six months before the commencement of the proceeding
and the child is absent from Arkansas, but a parent or person acting as a parent continues to live here; or
A court of another state does not have home state jurisdiction, or a court of the home state of the child has
declined to exercise jurisdiction on the ground that Arkansas is the more appropriate forum under § 9-19-
207 or § 9-19-208; and
The child and the child’s parents, or the child and at least one parent or a person acting as a parent, have a
significant connection with Arkansas other than mere physical presence; and substantial evidence is
available in Arkansas concerning the child’s care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or
All courts having jurisdiction through significant connection as set out immediately above have declined to
exercise jurisdiction on the ground that a court of Arkansas is the more appropriate forum to determine the
custody of the child under § 9-19-207 or § 9-19-208; or
No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under any of the criteria set out above.
The above is the exclusive jurisdictional basis for an Arkansas court to make a child-custody decision by an
Arkansas court.
Physical presence of, or personal jurisdiction over a party or a child is not necessary or sufficient to make a
child-custody determination.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-201; Ullrich v. Walsh, 2010 Ark. App. 290.
Exclusive Continuing Jurisdiction
Except as provided in § 9-19-204, an Arkansas court which has made a child custody
determination consistent with § 9-19-201 or § 9-19-203 has exclusive,
continuing jurisdiction over the determination until:
(1) An Arkansas court determines that neither the child, nor the child and one parent, nor the child and a
person acting as a parent have a significant connection with Arkansas, and that substantial evidence is no
longer available in Arkansas concerning the child’s care, protection, training, and personal relationships; or
(2) An Arkansas court or a court of another state determines that the child, the child’s parents, and any
person acting as a parent do not presently reside in Arkansas.
An Arkansas court which has made a child-custody determination and does not have exclusive, continuing
jurisdiction under this section may modify that determination only if it has jurisdiction to make an initial
determination under § 9-19-201.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-202;
Hatfield v. Miller, 2009 Ark. App. 832, 373 S.W.3d 366; Harris v. Harris, 2010 Ark. App. 160, 379
S.W.3d 8 (2010); Shields v. Kimble, 2010 Ark. App. 479, 375 S.W.3d 738.
The state of initial custody jurisdiction retains exclusive jurisdiction when one parent remains a resident no
matter how long the child and the other parent have been away.
62West v. West, 364 Ark. 73 (2005)(Arkansas had exclusive, continuing subject-matter jurisdiction to
determine modification of Arkansas custody order); Bridges v. Bridges, 93 Ark. App. 358 (2005)(Arkansas had
jurisdiction under PKPA and UCCJEA).
Jurisdiction to Modify Determination
Except as provided in § 9-19-204, an Arkansas court may not modify a child custody determination made by
a court of another state unless an Arkansas court has jurisdiction to make an initial determination under § 9-
19-201(a)(1) or (2) and:
(1) The court of the other state determines it no longer has exclusive,
continuing jurisdiction under § 9-19-202 or that an Arkansas court would
be a more convenient forum under § 9-19-207; or
(2) An Arkansas court or a court of the other state determines that the
child, the child’s parents, and any person acting as a parent do not
presently reside in the other state.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-203; Bridges v. Bridges, 93 Ark. App. 358, 219 S.W.3d 699
(2005); Devine v. Martens, 371 Ark. 60, 263 S.W.3d 515 (2007); Ullrich v. Walsh, 2010 Ark. App. 290.
Temporary Emergency Jurisdiction
An Arkansas court has temporary emergency jurisdiction if the child is present in Arkansas and the child has
been abandoned or it is necessary in an emergency to protect the child because the child or the child’s
sibling or parent is subjected to or threatened with mistreatment or abuse.
If no previous child-custody determination has been made that is entitled to
enforcement under the UCCJEA, and a child-custody proceeding has not been
commenced in a court of a state having jurisdiction under this Act, a child custody
determination made under this section remains in effect until an order is
entered by a court of a state having jurisdiction under the Act. If a child-custody
proceeding has not been or is not commenced in a court of a state having
jurisdiction under the Act, a child-custody determination made under this
temporary-emergency-jurisdiction section becomes a final determination, if it so
provides and this state becomes the home state of the child.
If there is a previous child-custody determination that is entitled to be enforced
or a child-custody proceeding has been commenced in a court of a state having
jurisdiction under the Act, any order issued by an Arkansas court under this
section must specify in the order a period that the court considers adequate to
allow the person seeking an order to obtain an order from the state having
jurisdiction under the Act. The order issued in Arkansas remains in effect until
the order is obtained from the other state within the period specified or the
period expires.
An Arkansas court which has been asked to make a child-custody decision based
upon this temporary-emergency-jurisdiction section, upon being informed that a
child-custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a determination has been
made by, a court of a state having jurisdiction under the Act, shall communicate
immediately with the other court. An Arkansas Court exercising jurisdiction
63pursuant to the jurisdictional sections of this Act, upon being informed that a
child-custody proceeding has been commenced in, or a child-custody
determination has been made by, a court of another state under a statute similar
to this section, shall communicate immediately with the court of the other state
to resolve the emergency, protect the safety of the parties and the child, and
determine a period for the duration of the temporary order.

App. 457.
Inconvenient Forum
An Arkansas court with jurisdiction under the UCCJEA to make a child-custody determination may decline to
exercise its jurisdiction at any time if it determines that it is an inconvenient forum under the circumstances
and that a court of another state is a more appropriate forum. The issue of inconvenient forum may
be raised upon motion of a party, the court’s own motion, or request of another court.
Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall consider whether it is
appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this purpose, the court shall allow the
parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant factors, including:
Whether domestic violence has occurred and is likely to continue in the future and which state could best
protect the parties and the child;
The length of time the child has resided outside the state;
The distance between the court in Arkansas and the court in the state that would assume jurisdiction;
The relative financial circumstances of the parties;
Any agreement of the parties about which state should assume jurisdiction;
The nature and location of the evidence required to resolve the pending litigation, including the testimony
of the child;
The ability of the court of each state to decide the issue expeditiously and the procedures necessary to
present the evidence; and
The familiarity of the court of each state with the facts and issues in the pending litigation.
If an Arkansas court determines that it is an inconvenient forum and that a court of another state is a more
appropriate forum, it shall stay the proceedings upon condition that a child-custody proceeding be promptly
commenced in another designated state and may impose any other condition the court considers just and
proper.
64An Arkansas court may decline to exercise its jurisdiction under this chapter if a child-custody determination
is incidental to an action for divorce or another proceeding while still retaining jurisdiction over the divorce
or other proceeding.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-19-207; Uttley v. Bobo, 97 Ark. App. 15, 242 S.W.3d 638 (2006); Hatfield v. Miller,

Ark. App. 457.
Jurisdiction Declined Because of Conduct
Except as otherwise provided in § 9-19-204 or by other Arkansas law, if an Arkansas Court has jurisdiction
under the UCCJEA because a person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction has engaged in unjustifiable conduct,
the court shall decline to exercise its jurisdiction unless:
The parents and all persons acting as parents have acquiesced in the exercise of jurisdiction;
A court of the state otherwise having jurisdiction under §§ 9-19-201–9-19-203 determines that Arkansas is a
more appropriate forum under § 9-19-207; or
No court of any other state would have jurisdiction under the criteria specified in §§ 9-19-201–9-19-203.
If an Arkansas court declines to exercise its jurisdiction because of unjustifiable conduct by a person seeking
to invoke its jurisdiction, the court may fashion an appropriate remedy to ensure the safety of the child and
prevent a repetition of the unjustifiable conduct, including staying the proceeding until a child-custody
proceeding is commenced in a court having jurisdiction under §§ 9-19-201–9-19-203.
If a court dismisses a petition or stays a proceeding because it declines to exercise its jurisdiction because of
the unjustifiable conduct of the person seeking to invoke its jurisdiction, it shall assess against that party
necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication expenses, attorney’s fees, investigative
fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and child care during the course of the proceedings, unless
the party from whom fees are sought establishes that the assessment would be clearly inappropriate. The
court may not assess fees, costs, or expenses against Arkansas unless authorized by law other than the
UCCJEA.

Information to be Submitted to the Court

Enforcement
Courts shall enforce other states’ child-custody determinations entered pursuant to the UCCJEA and
PKPA, unless the order has been vacated, stayed, or modified by a court having jurisdiction to do so under
this Act.
Ark. Code Ann. §9-19-313.
65Emergency jurisdiction still exists even though a child custody order entitled to enforcement is in effect. If
emergency jurisdiction is exercised, court communication is required to resolve the emergency, protect the
safety of the parties and the child(ren), and determine the period of duration of the order.

XIII. Paternity
Jurisdiction
An action to establish paternity shall be brought and shall proceed under the Arkansas Rules
of Civil Procedure applicable in circuit court. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-102.
66Limitation Periods & Venue
Actions brought in the State of Arkansas to establish paternity may be brought at any time.
Venue of paternity actions shall be in the county in which the plaintiff resides or, in cases
involving a juvenile, in the county in which the juvenile resides.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-102.
Transfer Between Local Jurisdictions
The court where the final decree of paternity is rendered shall retain jurisdiction of all
matters following the entry of the decree.
If more than six (6) months subsequent to the final adjudication, however, each of the
parties to the action has established a residence in a county of another judicial district
within the state, one (1) or both of the parties may petition the court that entered the final
adjudication to request that the case be transferred to another county.
The case shall not be transferred absent a showing that the best interest of the parties
justifies the transfer.
If a justification for transfer of the case has been made, there shall be an initial presumption
for transfer of the case to the county of residence of the physical custodian of the child.
If the court that entered the final adjudication agrees to transfer the case to another judicial
district, upon proper motion and affidavit and notice and payment of a refiling fee, the court
shall enter an order transferring the case and the refiling fee and charging the clerk of the
court to transmit forthwith certified copies of all records pertaining to the case to the clerk
of the court in the county where the case is being transferred.
An affidavit shall accompany the motion to transfer and recite that the parent or
parents, the physical custodian, and the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the
Revenue Division of the Department of Finance and Administration, as appropriate,
have been notified in writing that a request has been made to transfer the case.
Notification pursuant to this section must inform each recipient that any objection
must be filed within twenty (20) days from the date of receipt of the affidavit and
motion for transfer.
The clerk receiving a transferred case shall within fourteen (14) days of receipt set up a case
file, docket the case, and afford the case full faith and credit as if the case had originated in
that judicial district.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-102.
Standing & Burdens of Proof
67Petitions for paternity establishment may be filed by:
(1) A biological mother;
(2) A putative father;
(3) A person for whom paternity is not presumed or established by court order,
including a parent or grandparent of a deceased putative father; or
(4) The Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Revenue Division of the
Department of Finance and Administration.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-104.
A “putative father” is defined throughout the Arkansas Code as any man not legally
presumed or adjudicated to be the biological father of a child, but who claims or is alleged
to be the biological father of the child. R.N. v. J.M., 347 Ark. 203, 61 S.W.3d 149 (2001).
See also:
McAdams v. McAdams, 353 Ark. 494, 109 S.W.3d 649 (2003)(adoptive father who
had been adjudicated to be the biological father of child was not a “putative father”
who had standing to request paternity testing);
State Office of Child Support Enforcement v. Willis, 347 Ark. 6, 59 S.W.3d 438
(2001)(prior action for divorce between husband and wife was neither an
adjudication nor a voluntary acknowledgement of paternity, and, thus, subsequent
order declaring that husband was not child's biological father was result of an
original action to establish paternity, rather than an action to modify to which
statute of limitations for filing such action would apply);
R.N. v. J.M., 347 Ark. 203, 61 S.W.3d 149 (2001)(putative father, who had a sexual
relationship with a married woman, had standing under paternity statute to petition
to determine the paternity of minor child, even though statute applied to suits to
determine paternity of an “illegitimate child,” and child was presumed legitimate
because she was born during marriage); and
Hall v. Freeman, 327 Ark. 148, 936 S.W.2d 761 (1997)(child who was conceived and
born during mother's marriage to person other than putative father was presumed
to be child of marital partners and, thus, did not have standing to bring paternity
action against putative father pursuant to statute permitting persons for whom
paternity is not presumed or established by court order to bring petition for
paternity establishment).
68A rebuttable presumption arises that a child conceived, but not born, during the marriage is
a legitimate child. Only upon clear and convincing evidence may the court find this
presumption overcome.
The presumption of legitimacy of a child born during a marriage is a presumption to protect
the child whose interests should be considered first and foremost. And while this
presumption is rebuttable according to law, the challenging party must first show that
rebutting that presumption is in the best interest of a child.
See Ark. Code Ann. § 16-43-901 regarding competent witnesses as to paternity.
Name Change
The only relevant inquiry in determining whether to change the surname of a minor child is
what is in that child's best interest.
The burden of proof is on the moving party to demonstrate that the change is in the best
interest of the child.
The court must make the determination on a case-by-case basis through “thoughtful and
careful consideration” of the following six factors:
(1) the child's preference;
(2) the effect of the change of the child's surname on the preservation and
development of the child's relationship with each parent;
(3) the length of time the child has borne a given name;
(4) the degree of community respect associated with the present and proposed
surnames;
(5) the difficulties, harassment, or embarrassment that the child may experience
from bearing the present or proposed surname; and
(6) the existence of any parental misconduct or neglect.
Huffman v. Fisher, 343 Ark. 737, 38 S.W.3d 327 (2001).
See also Matthews v. Smith, 80 Ark. App. 396, 97 S.W.3d 418 (2003)(trial court adequately
applied all factors when it determined whether change of child's surname was in the child's
best interest; trial court acknowledged that the primary consideration was the best interest
of the child, that father bore the burden of proof, and it considered the child's age and
possible confusion to the child due to the name change);
Carter v. Reddell, 75 Ark. App. 8, 52 S.W.3d 506 (2001)(evidence of time that child had
borne her given name, effect of name change on her relationship with each of her parents,
69and the difficulties she may experience from bearing present or proposed surname was
sufficient to support finding that changing child's surname to that of father was in child's
best interest; child was four years old, each parent had established bond with child unlikely
to be altered by name change, stigma of name change minimal where she was just starting
school, mother had married and her surname was different from child's surname, and
mother had no plans to change child's surname to that of mother's husband);
Putt v. Suttles, 2011 Ark. App. 688, 386 S.W.3d 623 (2011)(the trial court is given discretion
in divorce cases on whether to order paternity testing and is instructed to consider the
child's best interest before ordering a test that could forever change a child's life merely
because the adults who caused such a tumultuous situation are curious to know the results
of their infidelity);
Bell v. Wardell, 72 Ark. App. 94, 34 S.W.3d 745 (2000)(chancery court's decision that it was
in seven-month-old child's best interest to change her surname from mother's surname to
that of father was not clearly erroneous, in paternity proceeding; father filed paternity
action only 19 days after child's birth, father offered to pay child support and child's medical
expenses, and father and his mother had sought visitation with child); and
Moon v. Marquez, 65 Ark. App. 78, 986 S.W.2d 103 (1999)(father's petition to modify
paternity order, requesting that child's surname be changed to the same as his, was not
barred by res judicata; although the order was final in that it could be appealed, in custody
cases, the order could later be modified upon a showing of sufficient change in
circumstances to justify modification).
Temporary Orders
If the child is not born when the accused appears before the circuit court, the court may
hear evidence and may make temporary orders and findings pending the birth of the child.
In all cases brought pursuant to Title IV-D of the Social Security Act, OCSE shall issue an
administrative order for paternity testing. OCSE bears initial cost, to be assessed against the
putative father if paternity is established or the applicant if the putative father is excluded.
Any paternity testing results obtained pursuant to an administrative order for paternity
testing shall be admissible into evidence in any circuit court for the purpose of adjudicating
paternity, as provided by § 9-10-108.
Upon motion by a party, the court shall issue a temporary child support order in accordance
with § 9-10-102 et seq., the guidelines for child support, and the family support chart, when
paternity is disputed and a judicial or administrative determination of paternity is pending, if
there is clear and convincing genetic evidence of paternity.
70If the mother should die before the final order, the action may be revived in the name of the
child, and the mother's testimony at the temporary hearing may be introduced in the final
hearing.
If the results of paternity testing exclude an alleged parent from being the biological parent
of the child, the office shall issue an administrative determination that declares that the
excluded person is not a parent of the child.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-103.
Paternity Test
Upon motion of either party in a paternity action, the trial court shall order that the putative
father, mother, and child submit to scientific testing for paternity, which may include
deoxyribonucleic acid testing, to determine whether or not the putative father can be
excluded as being the biological father of the child and to establish the probability of
paternity if the testing does not exclude the putative father.
If the results of the paternity tests establish a ninety-five percent (95%) or more probability
of inclusion that the putative father is the biological father of the child, after corroborating
testimony concerning the conception, birth, and history of the child, this shall constitute a
prima facie case of establishment of paternity, and the burden of proof shall shift to the
putative father to rebut that proof.
Whenever the court orders scientific testing for paternity and one (1) of the parties refuses
to submit to the testing, that fact shall be disclosed upon the trial and may be considered
civil contempt of court.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-108.
An order for a blood test is not a final order and therefore, is not appealable. Helton v.
Arkansas Dep't of Human Servs., 309 Ark. 268, 828 S.W.2d 842 (1992).
Putative fathers do not have a guaranteed right to counsel in paternity actions when their
physical liberty is not in jeopardy. Burrell v. Arkansas Dep't of Human Servs., 41 Ark. App.
140, 850 S.W.2d 8 (1993).
Similarly, Sixth Amendment right to confrontation does not apply as paternity is not a
criminal matter. Davis v. Child Support Enforcement Unit, 326 Ark. 677, 933 S.W.2d 798
(1996).
See State, Child Support Enforcement Unit v. Rogers, 50 Ark. App. 108, 902 S.W.2d 243
(1995)(in uniform reciprocal support action, putative father sufficiently rebutted any
presumption of paternity arising out of blood test results setting probability of his paternity
at 99.99%, where three witnesses testified that putative father had vasectomy prior to
71conception of child, lab report prepared eight years after birth of child indicated putative
father had zero sperm count, and mother swore in affidavit that she had sexual intercourse
only with man other than putative father within thirty-day period of date child was
conceived).
See also Ross v. Moore, 30 Ark. App. 207, 785 S.W.2d 243 (1990)(proper foundation was not
laid for admission in paternity proceeding of laboratory report on blood tests where there
was nothing to show that person who signed the report and stated that he was the
laboratory director was the person who performed the test, or that he was a qualified
expert).
Lying-In Expenses
If it is found by the court that the accused is the father of the child, the court shall render
judgment against him for the lying-in expenses in favor of the mother, person, or agency
incurring the lying-in expenses, if claimed.
If the lying-in expenses are not paid upon the rendition of the judgment, together with all
costs that may be adjudged against him in the case, then the court shall have the power to
commit the accused person to jail until the lying-in expenses are paid, with all costs.
Bills and invoices for pregnancy and childbirth expenses and paternity testing are admissible
as evidence in the circuit court or juvenile division of circuit court without third-party
foundation testimony if such bills or invoices are regular on their face.
Such bills or invoices shall constitute prima facie evidence of amounts incurred for such
services or for testing on behalf of the child.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-110.
Custody & Visitation in Paternity Cases
2021 Legislative Update: In an action concerning an original child custody determination in
a divorce or paternity matter, there is a rebuttable presumption that joint custody is in the
best interest of the child.
The presumption that joint custody is in the best interest of the child may be
rebutted:
(1) If the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that joint custody is
not in the best interest of the child;
(2) If the parties have reached an agreement on all issues related to custody
of the child;
(3) If one (1) of the parties does not request sole, primary, or joint custody;
or
72(4) If a rebuttable presumption described in subsection (c) or subsection (d)
of this section is established by the evidence (Note: see domestic violence and sex
offenders section on following page).
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-13-101(a)(1)(A)(iv).
Also see Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-113:
When a child is born to an unmarried woman, legal custody of that child shall be in the
woman giving birth to the child until the child reaches eighteen (18) years of age unless a
court of competent jurisdiction enters an order placing the child in the custody of another
party.
A biological father, provided he has established paternity in a court of competent
jurisdiction, may petition the circuit court in the county where the child resides for custody
of the child.
The court may award custody to the biological father upon a showing that:
(1) He is a fit parent to raise the child;
(2) He has assumed his responsibilities toward the child by providing care,
supervision, protection, and financial support for the child; and
(3) It is in the best interest of the child to award custody to the biological father.
When in the best interest of a child, visitation shall be awarded in a way that assures the
frequent and continuing contact of the child with the mother and the biological father.
See also Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-109(subsequent to the execution of an acknowledgment or
finding of paternity by the father and mother of a child, the court shall follow the same
guidelines, procedures, and requirements as set forth in the laws of this state applicable to
child support orders and judgments entered by the circuit court as if it were a case involving
a child born of a marriage in awarding custody, visitation, setting amounts of support, costs,
and attorney's fees).
Modification of Orders or Judgments
The circuit court may at any time enlarge, diminish, or vacate any order or judgment except
in regard to the issue of paternity as justice may require and on such notice to the
defendant as the court may prescribe.
The court shall not set aside, alter, or modify any final decree, order, or judgment of
paternity in which paternity blood testing, genetic testing, or other scientific evidence was
used to determine the adjudicated father as the biological father.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-115.
73Either party may rescind a voluntary acknowledgment by completing a form to be filed with
the Division of Vital Records before hearing date or within 60 days of executing a voluntary
acknowledgment, whichever date comes first.
Beyond sixty days, acknowledgment may be set aside only upon a filing of a petition
and a finding of fraud, duress, or material mistake of fact.
The burden of proof shall be upon the person challenging the establishment of
paternity.
When any man has been adjudicated to be the father of a child or is deemed to be the
father of a child pursuant to an acknowledgment of paternity without the benefit of
scientific testing for paternity and as a result was ordered to pay child support, he shall be
entitled to one (1) paternity test, pursuant to § 9-10-108, at any time during the period of
time that he is required to pay child support upon the filing of a motion challenging the
adjudication or acknowledgment of paternity in a court of competent jurisdiction.
The duty to pay child support and other legal obligations shall not be suspended
while the motion is pending except for good cause shown.
If the test excludes the adjudicated father or man deemed to be the father pursuant to an
acknowledgment of paternity as the biological father of the child and the court so finds, the
court shall:
(A) Set aside the previous finding or establishment of paternity;
(B) Find that there is no future obligation of support;
(C) Order that any unpaid support owed under the previous order is vacated; and
(D) Order that any support previously paid is not subject to refund.
If the name of the adjudicated father or man deemed to be the father pursuant to
an acknowledgment of paternity appears on the birth certificate of the child, the
court shall issue an order requiring the birth certificate to be amended to delete the
name of the father.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-115.
Also see Rivers v. DeBoer, 2019 Ark. App. 132
Circuit court's paternity judgment, which gave “woman giving birth” legal custody of
child born outside of marriage until subsequent court order placed him in custody of
another person, or he turned 18, pursuant to statute governing custody of child born
outside marriage, was initial custody order placing custody of child with biological mother,
as necessary to require biological father to prove material change in circumstances to obtain
74change in custody, even though judgment did not assign visitation rights, where biological
father had not asked for visitation or custody, and had not appeared before court for any
other related reason before it assigned paternity judgment. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-113.
Res Judicata
Res Judicata does not apply to bar a name change petition subsequent to the initial
paternity determination proceeding.
Moon v. Marquez, 65 Ark. App. 78, 986 S.W.2d 103 (1999).
Res judicata does not apply when two actions do not involve the same parties or their
privies.
State Office of Child Support Enforcement v. Willis, 347 Ark. 6, 59 S.W.3d 438
(2001)(court defined res judicata and collateral estoppel and adopted the principle
of collateral estoppel for the first time; collateral estoppel does not apply where the
issue of paternity was not litigated in the parties’ first divorce).
Acknowledgment of Paternity
A man is the father of a child for all intents and purposes if he and the mother execute an
acknowledgment of paternity of the child pursuant to § 20-18-408 or § 20-18-409, or a
similar acknowledgment executed during the child's minority.
Acknowledgments of paternity shall by operation of law constitute a conclusive finding of
paternity, subject to the modification of orders or judgments under § 9-10-115, and shall be
recognized by the chancery courts and juvenile divisions thereof as creating a parent and
child relationship between father and child.
Such acknowledgments of paternity shall also be recognized as forming the basis for
establishment and enforcement of a child support or visitation order without a further
proceeding to establish paternity.
The Department of Health shall offer voluntary paternity establishment services in all of its
offices throughout the state. The Department of Health shall coordinate such services with
the Office of Child Support Enforcement of the Revenue Division of the Department of
Finance and Administration. Upon submission of the acknowledgment of paternity to the
Division of Vital Records of the Department of Health, the State Registrar of Vital Records
shall accordingly establish a new or amended certificate of birth reflecting the name of the
father as recited in the acknowledgment of paternity.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-10-120.
75XIV. Domestic Abuse

Petitions. The petition shall be filed in the county where the petitioner resides, where the
alleged incident of abuse occurred, or where the respondent may be served. Ark. Code Ann.
§ 9-15-201.
“County where the petitioner resides” means the county in which the petitioner
physically resides at the time the petition is filed and may include a county where
the petitioner is located for a short-term stay in a domestic violence shelter. Ark.
Code Ann. § 9-15-103.
A petition may be filed by:
(1) Any adult family or household member on behalf of himself or herself;
(2) Any adult family or household member on behalf of another family or household
member who is a minor, including a married minor;
(3) Any adult family or household member on behalf of another family or household

Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-201.
A petition for relief shall:
(A) Allege the existence of domestic abuse;
(B) Disclose the existence of any pending litigation between the parties; and
(C) Disclose any prior filings of a petition for an order of protection under this
chapter.
The petition shall be accompanied by an affidavit made under oath that states the
specific facts and circumstances of the domestic abuse and the specific relief
sought.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-201.
When a petition alleges an immediate and present danger of domestic abuse or that the
respondent is scheduled to be released from incarceration within thirty (30) days and upon
the respondent's release there will be an immediate and present danger of domestic abuse,
76the court shall grant a temporary order of protection pending a full hearing if the court finds
sufficient evidence to support the petition. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-206.
Persons. Persons covered by the act include spouses, former spouses, parents and children,
persons related by blood within fourth degree of consanguinity (generally through great-
great-grandparents, great-great grandchildren, etc.), in-laws, any children residing in the

relationship and the frequency of interaction between the two people involved.
“Dating relationship” does not mean a casual relationship or ordinary fraternization
in a business or social context.

See Pablo v. Crowder, 95 Ark. App. 268, 236 S.W.3d 559 (2006)(parties’ dating
relationship of a couple of months, which appellant characterized as “serious,”
came within the definition of the applicable statute).
Also see Kankey v. Quimby, 2020 Ark. App. 471(Child's exposure to domestic abuse
against mother by her boyfriend did not constitute domestic abuse, and thus trial
court erred in extending order of protection to child, given that mother did not
allege in petition for order of protection, accompanying affidavit, or at hearing that
boyfriend perpetrated acts of violence against child.) Also see Morales v. Garcia,
2021 Ark. App. 438 with same facts.
Fees & Costs. The court, clerks of the court, and law enforcement agencies shall not require
any initial filing fees or service costs and the abused shall not bear the cost associated with
filing. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-202.
This subsection does not prohibit a judge from assessing costs against a petitioner if
the allegations of abuse are determined after a hearing to be false.
Also, in 2017, an additional court cost of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) is to be
assessed and remitted to the Administration of Justice Funds Section by the court
clerk for deposit as special revenues into the Domestic Violence Shelter Fund if a
person is the respondent on a permanent order of protection entered by a court
under this chapter.
77Time. The circuit court shall not deny a petitioner relief solely because the act of domestic
or family violence and the filing of the petition did not occur within one hundred twenty
(120) days. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-214.
Incarceration. Incarceration or imprisonment of the abusing party shall not bar the court
from issuing an ex parte temporary order of protection. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-206.

abusing party from doing, attempting to do, or threatening to do an act
injuring, mistreating, molesting, or harassing the petitioner.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-206.
A final order of protection may provide the following relief:
(1) Exclude the abusing party from the dwelling that the parties share or from the
residence of the petitioner or victim;
(2) Exclude the abusing party from the place of business or employment, school, or
other location of the petitioner or victim;
78(3) Award temporary custody or establish temporary visitation rights with regard to
minor children of the parties;
If a previous child custody or visitation determination has been made by
another court with continuing jurisdiction with regard to the minor children
of the parties, a temporary child custody or visitation determination may be
made. The order shall remain in effect until the court with original
jurisdiction enters a subsequent order regarding the children.
(4) Order temporary support for minor children or a spouse, with such support to be
enforced in the manner prescribed by law for other child support and alimony
awards;
(5) Allow the prevailing party a reasonable attorney's fee as part of the costs;

Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-205.
Time Limit. An order of protection shall be for a fixed period of time not less than ninety
(90) days nor more than ten (10) years in duration, in the discretion of the court, and may

Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-207.
A petitioner may omit his or her home address or business address from all documents filed
with the court. If a petitioner omits his or her home address, the petitioner shall provide the

petitioner's home address:
(A) After receiving the petitioner's consent;
(B) Orally and in chambers, out of the presence of the respondent, and a sealed
record to be made; or
(C) After a hearing, if the court takes into consideration the safety of the petitioner
and finds the disclosure in the interest of justice.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-203.
Time Frames
When a petition is filed pursuant to this chapter, the court shall order a hearing to be held
on the petition for the order of protection not later than thirty (30) days from the date on
which the petition is filed or at the next court date, whichever is later.
An ex parte temporary order of protection is effective until the date of the hearing on the
petition for the order of protection.
A denial of an ex parte temporary order of relief does not deny the petitioner the right to a
full hearing on the merits.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-204.
An order of protection shall be for a fixed period of time not less than ninety (90) days nor
more than ten (10) years in duration, in the discretion of the court, and may be renewed at

80The circuit clerk shall provide simplified forms and clerical assistance to help petitioners with
the writing and filing of a petition under this chapter if the petitioner is not represented by
counsel. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-203.
A sample Ex Parte Order of Protection and Final Order of Protection form can be found at
courts.arkansas.gov
Filing and service fees cannot be assessed against the petitioner at the time of filing, but
court may assess costs at the full hearing and may assess costs if the allegations of abuse in
the petition are found to be false. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-202.
Duties of Law Enforcement
Any order of protection is enforceable by a law enforcement agency with proper
jurisdiction. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-207.
The circuit court may order a law enforcement officer with jurisdiction to accompany the
petitioner and assist in placing the petitioner in possession of the dwelling or residence or to
otherwise assist in execution or service of the order of protection.
The court may also order a law enforcement officer to assist the petitioner in
returning to the residence and getting personal effects. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-208.
A law enforcement officer may file an affidavit alleging a violation of an order of protection,
after which a court may issue an order to respondent to appear and show cause why he or
she should not be held in contempt. Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-210.
A law enforcement officer shall not arrest a petitioner for the violation of an order of
protection issued against a respondent.
However, when a law enforcement officer has probable cause to believe that a
respondent has violated an order of protection and has been presented verification
of the existence of the order of protection, the officer may arrest the respondent
without a warrant whether or not the violation occurred in the presence of the
officer if the order of protection was obtained according to this chapter and the
Arkansas Rules of Criminal Procedure.
An order of protection issued by a court of competent jurisdiction in any county of this state
is enforceable in every county of this state by any court or law enforcement officer.
An order of protection shall include either:
(1) A finding that the respondent presents a credible threat to the physical safety of
a person named in an order of protection as a family or household member, a child of the
family or household member, or a child of the respondent or enjoined party; or
81(2) An explicit prohibition against the use, attempted use, or threatened use of
physical force against the person named in the order of protection as a family or household
member, a child of the family or household member, or a child of the respondent or
enjoined party which would reasonably be expected to cause bodily injury.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-207.
A law enforcement officer may make a warrantless arrest for domestic abuse, upon
probable cause that an act constituting domestic abuse was committed within the preceding
4 hours or the preceding 12 hours when physical injury is involved, even if the incident did
not take place in the officer’s presence.
When officer receives conflicting accounts of domestic violence, he or she shall evaluate
each account separately to determine if one party was the predominant aggressor. When
making determination, officer shall consider the following, based upon his or her
observation:
statements from parties of domestic violence and from other witnesses;
extent of personal injuries of parties;
evidence of self-defense;
prior complaints of domestic abuse if history is reasonably ascertainable;
any other relevant factors.
When officer has probable cause to believe that a party to an act of domestic abuse is the
predominant aggressor, the officer shall arrest that person with or without a warrant, under
the circumstances set out in the provision.
An officer acting in good faith and exercising due care in making an arrest for domestic
abuse is immune from civil liability.
Ark. Code Ann. § 16-81-113.
Full Faith & Credit
Any order of protection issued by a court of another state, a federally recognized Indian
tribe, or a territory shall be afforded full faith and credit by the courts of this state and shall
be enforced by law enforcement as if it were issued in this state if:
The court had jurisdiction over the parties and matters under the laws of the other
state, the federally recognized Indian tribe, or the territory; and
82Reasonable notice and opportunity to be heard was given to the person against
whom the order was sought sufficient to protect that person's right to due process.
In the case of ex parte orders, notice and opportunity to be heard must be
provided within the time required by the laws or rules of the other state,
the federally recognized Indian tribe, or the territory and, in any event,
within a reasonable time after the order is issued sufficient to protect the
due process rights of the party against whom the order is enforced.
An order of protection issued against both the petitioner and the respondent by a court of
another state, a federally recognized Indian tribe, or a territory shall not be enforceable
against the petitioner unless:
(1) The respondent filed a cross or counter petition, complaint, or other written
pleading seeking an order of protection;
(2) The issuing court made specific findings against both the petitioner and the
respondent; and
(3) The issuing court determined that each party was entitled to an order.
A person seeking recognition and enforcement of an out-of-state order of protection under
this section may present a copy of the order of protection to the local law enforcement
office in the city or county where enforcement of the order may be necessary. After
receiving a copy of the order of protection, the local law enforcement office shall enter the
order into the Arkansas Crime Information Center's protection order registry file. There shall
be no fee for entering the out-of-state order of protection. The law enforcement office shall
not notify the party against whom the order has been issued that an out-of-state order of
protection has been entered in this state. Entry of the out-of-state order of protection into
the center's protection order registry file shall not be required for enforcement of the order
of protection in this state.
When enforcing an out-of-state order of protection, a law enforcement officer shall
determine if there is probable cause to believe that an out-of-state order of protection
exists. A law enforcement officer may rely upon:
An out-of-state order of protection that has been provided to the officer by any
source; or
The statement of any person protected by an out-of-state order of protection that
the order exists; and verification by the clerk of the court of the other state, the
federally recognized Indian tribe, or the territory in writing, by telephone, or by
facsimile transmission or other electronic transmission.
83When enforcing an out-of-state order of protection, a law enforcement officer shall
determine if there is probable cause to believe that the terms of the order have been
violated. The law enforcement officer may rely upon:
(i) Any events he or she witnessed;
(ii) The statement of any person who claims to be a witness; or
(iii) Any other evidence.
A law enforcement officer shall not refuse to enforce the terms of the order of protection
on the grounds that the order has not been filed with the local law enforcement office or
entered into the center's protection order registry file unless the law enforcement officer
has a reasonable belief that the order is not authentic on its face.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-302.
Violation of an Order of Protection
An order of protection shall include a notice to the respondent or party restrained that:
(1) A violation of the order of protection is a Class A misdemeanor carrying a maximum
penalty of one (1) year imprisonment in the county jail or a fine of up to one thousand
dollars ($1,000), or both;
(2) A violation of an order of protection under this section within five (5) years of a previous
conviction for violation of an order of protection is a Class D felony;
(3) It is unlawful for an individual who is subject to an order of protection or convicted of a
misdemeanor of domestic violence to ship, transport, or possess a firearm or ammunition
pursuant to 18 U.S.C. § 922(g)(8) and (9) as it existed on January 1, 2007; and
(4) A conviction of violation of an order of protection under this section within five (5) years
of a previous conviction for violation of an order of protection is a Class D felony.
For respondents eighteen (18) years of age or older or emancipated minors, jurisdiction for
the criminal offense of violating the terms of an order of protection is with the circuit court
or other courts having jurisdiction over criminal matters.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-207.
A person who is charged with violating an order of protection (ex parte or final) may be
ordered as a condition of his or her release from custody to be placed under electronic
surveillance at his or her expense until the charge is adjudicated.
“Electronic surveillance” is a defined term in the statute.
84A person who is found guilty of violating an order of protection may be placed under
electronic surveillance at his or her expense as part of his or her sentence for a minimum of
four (4) months but not to exceed one (1) year.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-15-217.

Commencing July 1, 2017, to ensure that the petitioner may maintain his or her existing
wireless telephone number and the wireless numbers of minor children in the petitioner's
care, the court may issue an order directing a wireless telephone service provider to transfer
the billing responsibility for and rights to the wireless telephone number or numbers to the
petitioner if the petitioner: (1) Is not the account holder; and (2) Proves by a preponderance
of the evidence that the petitioner and any minor children in the petitioner's care are the
primary users of the wireless telephone numbers that will be ordered transferred by a court
under this subsection.

Ark. Code Ann. 9-15-219
Case Law – Orders of Protection
Claver v. Wilbur, 102 Ark. App. 53 (2008)(the Court of Appeals reversed the trial court’s
entry of a protective order as erroneous and unsupported by the evidence. The Court found
no statutory reason for issuing an order. The appellee’s 16-year-old daughter and the 20-
year old appellant were dating. The Court said the only proof showed that appellant
continued to see the teenager after her parents prohibited contact between them and that
the appellant had given the teenager a morning-after pill. No finding was made of sexual
conduct that would constitute a crime. No evidence was presented about physical harm,
bodily injury, assault, or the infliction of fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or
assault. Simply maintaining contact with a boyfriend or girlfriend without parental consent
does not rise to the level of domestic abuse).
Chiolak v. Chiolak, 99 Ark. App. 277 (2007)(the trial court did not err in deciding the issue of
visitation in a protective order case even though the parties had just divorced in another
division of the same circuit. In ordering that visitation would cease, the trial court made it
87clear that the protective order was subject to modification by the division that had granted
the divorce. Visitation was discontinued only until the divorce court could conduct a
hearing and rule in light of the child’s allegations of abuse against the father. Res judicata
did not bar issues raised by the order of protection, according to the Court, which said that
custody and visitation orders are always subject to modification for changed circumstances
and the best interest of the child).
Simmons v. Dixon, 96 Ark. App. 260 (2006)(trial court’s granting of an order of protection
based upon appellee’s petition based upon allegations that appellant threatened her and
her dog was affirmed. The Court of Appeals found that the evidence was sufficient to show
that appellant sent threatening text messages to appellee and that appellee claimed she
was afraid after receiving the messages. That was sufficient to show the infliction of fear of
“imminent” physical harm under the domestic abuse statutes).
Pablo v. Crowder, 95 Ark. App. 268 (2006)(parties’ dating relationship of a couple of months,
which appellant characterized as “serious,” was long enough to bring it within the definition
of the Domestic Abuse Act).
Stahl v. Smith, 2017 Ark. App. 603 (the appellate court found error in the circuit court’s
entering a final order of protection based on a finding that Appellant had committed
domestic abuse against the parties’ child. A petition for order of protection shall allege,
among other things, the existence of domestic abuse. Because there is no evidence on the
record of harm or injury by Appellant, the circuit court must have relied on the second
portion of the domestic abuse definition, i.e. that Appellant inflicted fear of imminent
physical harm. The only evidence to arguably support such a finding was that Appellant
failed to protect the child from alleged abuse, that Appellant thought the child was lying
about the abuse, that Appellant became aggressive and angry when speaking to the child
about the allegations, and that Appellant continued to allow the child around the alleged
abuser. The appellate court found that this evidence, even if assuming all of Appellee’s
testimony is true, is insufficient to support the domestic abuse filing.)

(8) any other matter, including their personal rights and obligations, not in violation
of public policy or a statute imposing a criminal penalty.
The right of a child to support may not be adversely affected by a premarital agreement.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-403.
After marriage, a premarital agreement may be amended or revoked only by a written
agreement signed by the parties. The amended agreement or the revocation is enforceable
without consideration.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-405.
Enforcement
A premarital agreement is not enforceable if the party against whom enforcement is sought
proves that:
(1) that party did not execute the agreement voluntarily; or
(2) the agreement was unconscionable when it was executed and, before execution
of the agreement, that party:
(i) was not provided a fair and reasonable disclosure of the property or
financial obligations of the other party;
(ii) did not voluntarily and expressly waive after consulting with legal
counsel, in writing, any right to disclosure of the property or financial
obligations of the other party beyond the disclosure provided; and
(iii) did not have, or reasonably could not have had, an adequate knowledge
of the property or financial obligations of the other party.
If a provision of a premarital agreement modifies or eliminates spousal support and that
modification or elimination causes one (1) party to the agreement to be eligible for support
under a program of public assistance at the time of separation or marital dissolution, a
court, notwithstanding the terms of the agreement, may require the other party to provide
support to the extent necessary to avoid that eligibility.
An issue of unconscionability of a premarital agreement shall be decided by the court as a
matter of law.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-11-406.
Case law.
90Prenuptial agreement statutes only apply to agreements made prior to marriage. Stewart v.
Combs, 368 Ark. 121, 243 S.W.3d 294 (2006).
See Woods v. Woods, 2020 Ark. App. 469 (Circuit court's award of exclusive use and control
of marital home to wife until minor child reached age of majority was in error in divorce
proceeding; parties' premarital agreement clearly contemplated that in the event of divorce,
any property held by parties as tenants in common would be sold and proceeds divided
equally, and award was not equitable or just, given that in addition to her nonmarital assets
valued at $1.5 million, wife would receive approximately $1,000,000 as her share from sales
of marital home and lake house from which she could use to establish new home.)
See also Rogers v. Rogers, 90 Ark. App. 321, 205 S.W.3d 856 (2005)(the rule of evidence that
governed the admissibility of compromises and offers to compromise did not apply to
preclude admission of two partial stipulated property agreements executed by husband and
wife, in divorce proceeding; the partial stipulated agreements were fully executed
agreements, and they were offered for enforcement and were not offered for the purpose
of “proving liability for, invalidity of, or amount of the claim.”).
XVI. Reconciliation Agreements
Reconciliation agreements are an exception to the marital property law. See Ark. Code Ann.
§ 9-12-315.
Reconciliation agreements are not against public policy since the law encourages the
resumption of marital relations. See Schichtel v. Schichtel, 3 Ark. App. 36, 621 S.W.2d 504
(1981)(the law encourages the resumption of marital relations. Since the purpose of a
reconciliation agreement is to restore marital relations, it harmonizes with public policy and
will be upheld. The Court held that a contract between husband and wife, made when they
were separated for just cause, whereby the husband agrees to pay his wife a specified sum
if she will resume marital relations, rests upon a valuable consideration and is enforceable);
Grover v. Grover, 101 Ark. App. 346, 276 S.W.3d 740 (2008)(circuit court's finding that wife
signed the reconciliation agreement under duress, which was grounds for setting aside the
agreement under Florida law, was not clearly erroneous; husband had not fully disclosed the
nature of his military benefits, the parties had ended the divorce litigation and resumed
their fiduciary relationship, wife signed the agreement without the benefit of legal counsel,
and wife had returned to Florida with the parties' minor child to begin reconciliation
efforts);
Arnold v. Arnold, 261 Ark. 734, 747, 553 S.W.2d 251, 258 (1977)(concerning the question of
whether a separation agreement survives a reconciliation; the court held that it depends on
the intention of the parties. But, when there is a property settlement, it is generally held to
91be a final and binding contract between the parties which can only be voided by mutual
agreement. Reconciliation alone does not terminate the settlement. Therefore the
settlement survives the reconciliation unless the court can find an intention or an express
agreement that it shall not survive); and
Ducharme v. Ducharme, 316 Ark. 482, 872 S.W.2d 392 (1994)(Louisiana law, rather than
Arkansas law, applied to determine legal efficacy of act of donation whereby wife gave up
her usufruct for her husband's life in certain notes receivable and real property located in
Louisiana, considering that Louisiana was place of contracting, and was location of real
property specified in agreement).
XVII. Mediation and Alternative Dispute Resolution
Duty & Authority of Courts
It is the duty of each trial and appellate court of this state and each court is hereby vested
with the authority to encourage the settlement of cases and controversies pending before it
by suggesting the referral of a case or controversy to an appropriate dispute resolution
process agreeable to the parties.
On motion of all the parties, the court must make such an order of reference and continue
the case or controversy pending the outcome of the selected dispute resolution process.
In addition, each circuit and appellate court of this state is vested with the authority to
order any civil, juvenile, probate, or domestic relations case or controversy pending before it
to mediation.
If a case or controversy is ordered to mediation, the parties may:
(1) Choose an appropriate mediator from a roster provided by the Arkansas Alternative
Dispute Resolution Commission of those mediators who meet the commission's
requirement guidelines for that type of case; or
(2) Select a mediator not on the commission's roster, if approved by the court.
A party may move to dispense with the order to mediate for good cause shown.
92“Good cause shown” shall include, but not be limited to, a party's inability to pay
the costs of mediation.
Each court is further granted the discretionary authority to make at the request of a party
appropriate orders to confirm and enforce the results produced by the dispute resolution
process.
Ark. Code Ann. § 16-7-202.
Confidentiality
Except as provided below, a communication relating to the subject matter of any civil or
criminal dispute made by a participant in a dispute resolution process, whether before or
after the institution of formal judicial proceedings, is confidential and is not subject to
disclosure and may not be used as evidence against a participant in any judicial or
administrative proceeding.
Any record or writing made at a dispute resolution process is confidential, and the
participants or third party or parties facilitating the process shall not be required to testify in
any proceedings related to or arising out of the matter in dispute or be subject to process
requiring disclosure or production of information or data relating to or arising out of the
matter in dispute.
If this section conflicts with other legal requirements for disclosure of communications or
materials, the issue of confidentiality may be presented to the court having jurisdiction of
the proceedings to determine in camera whether the facts, circumstances, and context of
the communications or materials sought to be disclosed warrant a protective order of the
court or whether the communications or materials are subject to disclosure.
Ark. Code Ann. § 16-7-206.
See Smyth vs. Smyth, 2019 Ark. App. 12 (The requirement of confidentiality set out in Ark.
Code Ann. § 16-7-206 does not prevent the court from knowing the subject matter of the mediation.)
Also see Wynne-Ark, Inc. D/B/A Kelleys’ Restaurant vs. Richard Baugh Construction, 2020 Ark.
App. 140, which addresses discoverability of confidential mediated settlement agreement.
Immunity
No impartial third party administering or participating in a dispute resolution process shall
be held liable for civil damages for any statement or decision made in connection with or
arising out of the conduct of a dispute resolution process unless the person acted in a
manner exhibiting willful or wanton misconduct.
93Ark. Code Ann. § 16-7-207.
Options Available to Courts
When the parties to a divorce action have minor children residing with one (1) or both
parents, the court, prior to or after entering a decree of divorce, may require the parties to:
(1) Complete at least two (2) hours of classes concerning parenting issues faced by
divorced parents; or
(2) Submit to mediation in regard to addressing parenting, custody, and visitation
issues.
Each party shall be responsible for his or her cost of attending classes or mediation.
The parties may:
(1) Choose a mediator from a list provided by the judge of those mediators who
have met the Arkansas Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission's requirement
guidelines for inclusion on a court-connected mediation roster; or
(2) Select a mediator not on the roster, if approved by the judge.
A party may move to dispense with the referral to mediation for good cause shown.
Ark. Code Ann. § 9-12-322.
Selection of Mediator
When a case is ordered to mediation pursuant to Ark. Code Ann. §16-7-202 or §9-12-322 the
parties may:
(1) Choose an appropriate mediator from a roster provided by the Arkansas Alternative Dispute
Resolution Commission of those mediators who meet the Commission's requirement
guidelines for that type of case; or
(2) Select a mediator not on the Commission's roster, if approved by the court
Access and Visitation Program
http://www.araccess.org/
The Arkansas Access and Visitation Program is a statewide mediation program serving residents of
the state who would like to mediate issues of custody, visitation, and child support for their minor
children. Mediation services are provided to participants at a reduced rate based on
the participant's income.
The Access and Visitation Program was created in 1997 and is funded by a federal grant from the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Office of Child Support Enforcement. The purpose
94of the grant is to support and facilitate noncustodial parents’ access to and visitation with
their children.
The program provides up 6 hours of free or reduced cost mediation services to Arkansas residents
with qualifying issues. Qualifying issues are custody, visitation or child support. The cost that each
party pays is determined by their income and number of dependents. The program serves all
parents, regardless of marital status. They may be in the process of divorcing, already divorced and
seeking to change the custody, visitation, or support arrangement, or never married. A court order
is not necessary to be eligible for the program.
Regulation of Mediators
The Arkansas Alternative Dispute Resolution Commission is responsible for the regulation of
mediators who are eligible to mediate court ordered cases. If the parties use a mediator who is not
on the Commission’ roster, that mediator is not bound by ethical rules or subject to discipline by the
ADR Commission.
The ADR Commission is housed and staffed within the Administrative Office of the Courts. See Ark.
Code Ann. §16-7-201 et. seq. for information on the Commission’s establishment, and powers and
duties.
The Commission’s rules for certification are set out in the Requirements for the Certification of
Mediators for Circuit Courts.
All certified mediators must adhere to ethical rules set out in the Requirements for the Conduct of
Mediation and Mediators.
Pursuant to Standard 7 of the ethical rules for mediators, the mediator is prohibited from providing
an assessment, evaluation, recommendation, finding, or other communication regarding the
mediation to the court.
The mediator may file a mediator’s report with the court stating:
1) whether or not the mediation occurred or has terminated;
2) whether a settlement was reached; and
3) who attended the mediation.
XVIII. Name Change for a Child
Best Interest & Factors
95The controlling consideration is whether the name change is in the child's best interest.
Poindexter v. Poindexter, 360 Ark. 538, 203 S.W.3d 84 (2005)(the rule was applied to middle
names as well as to surnames).
In determining the child's best interest, the controlling consideration, the trial court should
consider at least the following factors:
(1) the child's preference;
(2) the effect of the change of the child's surname on the preservation and
development of the child's relationship with each parent;
(3) the length of time the child has borne a given name;
(4) the degree of community respect associated with the present and proposed
surnames;
(5) the difficulties, harassment, or embarrassment that the child may experience
from bearing the present or proposed surname; and
(6) the existence of any parental misconduct or neglect.
Huffman v. Fisher, 337 Ark. 58, 987 S.W.2d 269 (1999)(where the factors were first
enumerated; “norm in the locale,” as to how children receive surnames, is not one
of the factors to be considered in determining the child's best interest, although
such evidence may be relevant in determining whether the child may experience
difficulties, harassment, or embarrassment from bearing a particular surname).
Where a full inquiry is made by the trial court regarding the implication of Huffman factors
governing requests to change a child's name and a determination is made with due regard
to the best interest of the child, the trial court's decision regarding change of surname will
be upheld where it is not clearly erroneous.
The burden of proof is on the party seeking change of child's surname to demonstrate that
the name change is in the best interest of the child.
Gangi v. Edmonds, 93 Ark. App. 217, 218 S.W.3d 339 (2005)(trial court's finding that,
if child continued to bear his mother's surname, everyone would know that his
parents had not been married and this would cause child embarrassment was not
supported by any evidence; the marriage of a child's mother and her consequent
assumption of her husband's surname, as is customary in the state, should not
provide a basis for changing the child's surname to that of his father, where no such
consequence may be triggered by the father's marriage; evidence in connection
with unwed father's petition to change the surname of parties' minor child from
that of mother to father indicated that father exhibited such parental misconduct
96and neglect as to weigh heavily against changing child's surname to that of his
father).
See also Boudreaux v. Mauterstock, 88 Ark. App. 389, 199 S.W.3d 120 (2004)(child's
adjudicated father failed to carry his burden, in proceedings on his petition for change of
child's surname, of demonstrating that change was in child's best interest, where father
presented no evidence other than what could be gleaned from testimony regarding his
petition for change of custody, and mere fact that child would have last name different from
that of her father in absence of change did not establish that it was in child's best interest
that her surname be changed);
Sheppard v. Speir, 85 Ark. App. 481, 157 S.W.3d 583 (2004)(following change of custody of
illegitimate child from mother to father, change of child's name from “Weather'By Dot Com
Chanel Fourcast Sheppard” to “Samuel Charles Speir” was in child's best interests; child was
of a very tender age and could show no preference, mother had been married multiple
times and her other children had different surnames, father shared surname with his wife
and other children, mother's surname was associated in the community with her numerous
arrests, no disrespect was associated with father's surname, and child's unusual birth name,
as argued by father and implicitly recognized by mother, would subject child to difficulties,
harassment, and embarrassment); and
Walker v. Burton, 2011 Ark. App. 439, 384 S.W.3d 605 (2011)(evidence was sufficient to
establish that child's best interests would be served by granting maternal stepgrandfather's
petition to change child's surname to that of stepgrandfather's; child wanted to assume the
last name of his stepgrandfather who had been awarded custody of child shortly before
death of child's mother and maternal grandmother, child's father, who objected to
stepgrandfather's name-change petition, had been incarcerated for committing offense
related to mother's death, and evidence tended to show that changing child's name would
have little effect on the preservation and development of child's relationship with his father
since there was hardly a relationship there to begin with, father having been incarcerated
for half of child's life).
