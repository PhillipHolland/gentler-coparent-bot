13RULE 12.000. PREFACE
These rules consist of two separate sections. Section I contains the
procedural rules governing family law matters and their commentary. Section II
contains forms.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. These rules were adopted after the Florida Supreme Court
determined that separate rules for family court procedure were necessary. See In re
Florida R. Fam. Ct. P., 607 So.2d 396 (Fla. 1992). The court recognized that
family law cases are different from other civil matters, emphasizing that the 1993
creation of family divisions in the circuit courts underscored the differences
between family law matters and other civil matters. In adopting the family law
rules, the Court stressed the need for simplicity due to the large number of pro se
litigants (parties without counsel) in family law matters. In an effort to assist the
many pro se litigants in this field, the Court has included simplified forms and
instructional commentary in these rules. See Section II. The instructional
commentary to the forms refers to these rules or the Florida Rules of Civil
Procedure, where applicable.
The forms originally were adopted by the Court pursuant to Family Law
Rules of Procedure, No. 84,337 (Fla. July 7, 1995); In re Petition for Approval of
Forms Pursuant to Rule 10-1.1(b) of the Rules Regulating the Florida Bar—
Stepparent Adoption Forms, 613 So.2d 900 (Fla. 1992); Rules Regulating the
Florida Bar—Approval of Forms, 581 So.2d 902 (Fla. 1991).
SECTION I
FAMILY LAW RULES OF PROCEDURE
RULE 12.003. COORDINATION OF RELATED FAMILY CASES AND
HEARINGS
(a) Assignment to One Judge.
(1) unless impractical.
All related family cases must be handled before one judge
(2) If it is impractical for one judge to handle all related family
cases, the judges assigned to hear the related cases involving the same family
and/or children may confer for the purpose of case management and coordination
14of the cases. Notice and communication shall comply with Canon 3.B.(7) of the
Code of Judicial Conduct. The party who filed the notice of related cases or the
court may coordinate a case management conference under rule 12.200 between
the parties and the judges hearing the related cases. In addition to the issues that
may be considered, the court shall:
(A) consolidate as many issues as is practical to be heard by
one judge;
(B) coordinate the progress of the remaining issues to
facilitate the resolution of the pending actions and to avoid inconsistent rulings;
(C) determine the attendance or participation of any minor
child in the proceedings if the related cases include a juvenile action; and
(D) determine the access of the parties to court records if a
related case is confidential pursuant to Florida Rule of Judicial Administration
2.420.
(b) Joint Hearings or Trials.
(1) The court may order joint hearings or trials of any issues in
related family cases.
(2) For joint or coordinated hearings, notice to all parties and to all
attorneys of record in each related case shall be provided by the court, the moving
party, or other party as ordered by the court, regardless of whether or not the party
providing notice is a party in every case number that will be called for hearing.
RULE 12.004. JUDICIAL ACCESS AND REVIEW OF RELATED
FAMILY FILES
(a) In General. A judge hearing a family case may access and review the
files of any related case either pending or closed, to aid in carrying out his or her
adjudicative responsibilities. Authorized court staff and personnel may also access
and review the file of any related case.
(b) Family Case Defined. For purposes of this rule, a related family case
is another pending or closed case separate from the pending case, as defined in
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.545(d).
15(c) Nondisclosure of Confidential Information. Judges or authorized
court personnel shall not disclose confidential information and documents
contained in related case files except in accordance with applicable state and
federal confidentiality laws.
(d) Notice by Court Staff. Authorized court staff may advise the court
about the existence of related legal proceedings, the legal issues involved, and
administrative information about such cases.
RULE 12.005. TRANSITION RULE
These rules apply to all family law cases as of March 16, 2017. Any action
taken in a family law case before March 16, 2017, that conformed to the then-
effective rules or statutes governing family law cases, will be regarded as valid
during the pendency of the litigation.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule provides for an effective date of January 1, 1996,
for these Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure. Under this rule, any action taken
in a family law matter before January 1, 1996, will be regarded as valid during the
pendency of the litigation so long as that action was taken in accordance with the
then-effective rules or statutes governing family law cases. Any action taken after
January 1, 1996, in new or pending family law cases will be governed by these
rules.
RULE 12.006. FILING COPIES OF ORDERS IN RELATED FAMILY
CASES
The court may file copies of court orders in related family cases involving
the same parties. All relevant case numbers should be placed on the order and a
separate copy placed in each related case file.
RULE 12.007. ACCESS AND REVIEW OF RELATED FAMILY FILES
BY PARTIES
(a) In General. Access to confidential files in related cases shall not be
granted except as authorized by Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420.
(b) Confidentiality of Address. When a petitioner for domestic violence
injunction requests that his or her address be kept confidential pursuant to section
16741.30, Florida Statutes, this information is exempt from the public records
provisions of section 119.07(1), Florida Statutes and article I, section 24(a), Florida
Constitution, and is a confidential court record under Rule of Judicial
Administration 2.420(d). Persons with authorized access to confidential
information shall develop methods to ensure that the address remains confidential
as provided by law.
(c) Disclosure Prohibited. Disclosure by parties of confidential
information and documents contained in court files for related family cases, except
in accordance with applicable state and federal confidentiality statutes, is
prohibited.
RULE 12.010. SCOPE, PURPOSE, AND TITLE
(a) Scope.
(1) These rules apply to all actions concerning family matters,
including injunctions for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, and sexual
violence, and stalking, except as otherwise provided by the Florida Rules of
Juvenile Procedure or the Florida Probate Rules. “Family matters,” “family law
matters,” or “family law cases” as used within these rules include, but are not
limited to, matters arising from dissolution of marriage, annulment, support
unconnected with dissolution of marriage, paternity, child support, an action
involving a parenting plan for a minor child or children (except as otherwise
provided by the Florida Rules of Juvenile Procedure), proceedings for temporary
or concurrent custody of minor children by extended family, adoption, proceedings
for emancipation of a minor, declaratory judgment actions related to premarital,
marital, or postmarital agreements (except as otherwise provided, when applicable,
by the Florida Probate Rules), injunctions for protection against domestic, repeat,
dating, and sexual violence, and stalking, and all proceedings for modification,
enforcement, and civil contempt of these actions.
(2) The form, content, procedure, and time for pleading in all
proceedings shall be as prescribed by the statutes governing the proceeding unless
these rules or the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration, where applicable,
specifically provide to the contrary. All actions under these rules shall also be
governed by the Florida Evidence Code, which applies in cases where a conflict
with these rules may occur.
(b) Purpose.
17(1) These rules are intended to facilitate access to the court and to
provide procedural fairness to all parties, to save time and expense through active
case management, setting timetables, and the use of alternatives to litigation, and to
enable the court to coordinate related cases and proceedings to avoid multiple
appearances by the same parties on the same or similar issues and to avoid
inconsistent court orders.
(2) Nothing shall prohibit any intake personnel in family law
divisions from assisting in the preparation of documents or forms to be filed in any
action under these rules.
(c) Title. These rules shall be known as the Florida Family Law Rules of
Procedure and abbreviated as Fla. Fam. L. R. P.

Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425, Minimization of the Filing of
Sensitive Information.

Commentary
2000 Adoption. To help the many people in family law court cases who do
not have attorneys to represent them (pro se litigants), the Florida Supreme Court
added simplified forms and directions to the Florida Family Law Rules of
Procedure when adopting the rules in 1995. These forms initially had been adopted
by the Court in In re Family Law Rules of Procedure, 663 So.2d 1049 (Fla. 1995);
In re Petition for Approval of Forms Pursuant to Rule 10-1.1(b) of the Rules
Regulating the Florida Bar—Stepparent Adoption Forms, 613 So.2d 900 (Fla.
1992), and Rules Regulating The Florida Bar—Approval of Forms, 581 So.2d 902
(Fla. 1991).
In 1997, in an effort to fulfill the spirit of the Court’s directives to simplify
the process of litigation in family law matters, the Family Court Steering
Committee completely revised the existing forms and added new forms and
instructions. The rules and forms then constituted more than 500 pages.
Subdivision (b) of this rule was adopted in recognition that the forms would
require continuous updating and that the rulemaking process was too cumbersome
for such an undertaking.

filing of a Cover Sheet for Family Court Cases, Form 12.928, in every proceeding
to which the Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure apply and to require the
Family Law Rules Committee to be responsible for proposing amendments as
necessary.

21RULE 12.025 APPLICABILITY OF RULES OF JUDICIAL
ADMINISTRATION
(a) Electronic Filing. Florida Rules of Judicial Administration 2.520 and
2.525 are applicable in all family law matters except as otherwise provided in these
rules.
(b) Exceptions. Any document filed pursuant to any proceeding under
Chapter 63, Florida Statutes, which may be relied upon by the court to terminate
parental rights, including consent for adoption or affidavit of nonpaternity, shall be
exempt from the requirements of Rule of Judicial Administration 2.525(c).
RULE 12.030. VERIFICATION OF PLEADINGS
Except as otherwise provided in these rules, verification of pleadings shall
be governed by the Florida Rules of Judicial Administration or applicable statute.
RULE 12.040. ATTORNEYS
(a) Limited Appearance. An attorney of record for a party, in a family
law matter governed by these rules, shall be the attorney of record throughout the
same family law matter, unless at the time of appearance the attorney files a notice,
signed by the party, specifically limiting the attorney’s appearance only to the
particular proceeding or matter in which the attorney appears.
(b) Withdrawal or Limiting Appearance.
(1) Prior to the completion of a family law matter or prior to the
completion of a limited appearance, an attorney of record, with approval of the
court, may withdraw or partially withdraw, thereby limiting the scope of the
attorney’s original appearance to a particular proceeding or matter. A motion
setting forth the reasons must be filed with the court and served upon the client and
interested persons.
(2) The attorney shall remain attorney of record until such time as
the court enters an order, except as set forth in subdivision (c) below.

proceeding or matter, as provided by this rule, that attorney shall be deemed “of
22record” for only that particular proceeding or matter. Any notice of limited
appearance filed shall include the name, address, e-mail address(es), and telephone
number of the attorney and the name, address, and telephone number of the party.
If the party designates e-mail address(es) for service on and by that party, the
party’s e-mail address(es) shall also be included. At the conclusion of such
proceeding or matter, the attorney’s role terminates without the necessity of leave
of court, upon the attorney filing a notice of completion of limited appearance. The
notice, which shall be titled “Termination of Limited Appearance,” shall include
the names and last known addresses of the person(s) represented by the
withdrawing attorney.
(2) An attorney for the State’s Title IV-D child support
enforcement agency who appears in a family law matter governed by these rules
shall file a notice informing the recipient of Title IV-D services and other parties to
the case that the IV-D attorney represents only the Title IV-D agency and not the
recipient of IV-D services. The notice must state that the IV-D attorney may only
address issues concerning determination of paternity, and establishment,
modification, and enforcement of support obligations. The notice may be
incorporated into a pleading, motion, or other document filed with the court when
the attorney first appears.
(d) Preparation of Pleadings or Other Documents. A party who files a
pleading or other document of record pro se with the assistance of an attorney shall
certify that the party has received assistance from an attorney in the preparation of
the pleading or other document. The name, address, and telephone number of the
party shall appear on all pleadings or other documents filed with the court. If the
party designates e-mail address(es) for service on and by that party, the party’s e-
mail address(es) shall also be included.

other documents and all notices of hearing shall be served upon both the attorney
23and the party. If the attorney receives notice of a hearing that is not within the
scope of the limited representation, the attorney shall notify the court and the
opposing party that the attorney will not attend the court proceeding or hearing
because it is outside the scope of the representation.
Committee Notes
2012 Amendment. Subdivisions (c), (d), and (e) are amended to provide e-

RULE 12.050. WHEN ACTION COMMENCED
Every family law matter shall be deemed commenced when the petition is
filed, except that ancillary proceedings shall be deemed commenced when the writ
is issued or the pleading setting forth the claim of the party initiating the action is
filed.
RULE 12.060. TRANSFERS OF ACTIONS
(a) Transfers of Courts. If it should appear at any time that an action is
pending in the wrong court of any county, it may be transferred to the proper court
within the county by the same method as provided by Florida law.
(b) Wrong Venue. When any action is filed placing venue in the wrong
county, the court may transfer the action in the manner provided by Florida law to
the proper court in any county in which it might have been brought in accordance
with the venue statutes. When the venue might have been placed in 2 or more
counties, the person bringing the action may select the county to which the action
is transferred. If no such selection is made, the matter shall be determined by the
court.
(c) Method. The service charge of the clerk of the court to which an
action is transferred under this rule must be paid by the party who commenced the
action within 30 days from the date the order of transfer is entered, subject to
taxation as provided by law when the action is determined. If the service charge is
not paid within the 30 days, the action may be dismissed without prejudice by the
court that entered the order of transfer.
RULE 12.070. PROCESS
(a) Issuance of Summons.
24(1) In General. On the commencement of the action, including
proceedings to modify a final judgment, summons or other process authorized by
law must be issued immediately by the clerk or judge under the clerk’s or the
judge’s signature and the seal of the court and delivered for service.
(2) Contents of Summons. All summons in family law matters
must be patterned after Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.910(a)
and must specifically contain the following language:
WARNING: Rule 12.285, Florida Family Law Rules of
Procedure, requires certain automatic disclosure of
documents and information. Failure to comply can result
in sanctions, including dismissal or striking of pleadings.
(b) Service; By Whom Made. Service of process may be made by an
officer authorized by law to serve process, but the court may appoint any
competent person not interested in the action to serve the process. When so
appointed, the person serving process must make proof of service by affidavit
promptly and in any event within the time during which the person served must
respond to the process. Failure to make proof of service will not affect the validity
of the service. When any process is returned not executed or returned improperly
executed for any respondent, the party causing its issuance must be entitled to such
additional process against the unserved party as is required to effect service.
(c) Service; Numerous Respondents. If there is more than 1 respondent,
the clerk or judge must issue as many writs of process against the several
respondents as may be directed by the petitioner or the petitioner’s attorney.
(d) Service by Publication. Service of process by publication may be
made as provided by statute.
(e) Constructive Service.
(1) For constructive service of process on the legal father in any
case or proceeding to establish paternity which would result in termination of the
legal father’s parental rights, the petitioner must file an affidavit of diligent search
and inquiry that conforms with Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form
12.913(c). If the legal father cannot be located, he must be served with process by
publication in the manner provided by chapter 49, Florida Statutes. The notice
must be published in the county where the legal father was last known to have
25resided. The clerk of the circuit court must mail a copy of the notice to the legal
father at his last known address.
(2) For constructive service of process in any case or proceeding
involving parental responsibility, custody, or time-sharing with a minor child, the
petitioner must file an affidavit of diligent search and inquiry that conforms with
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(c). If the responding party
cannot be located, the party must be served with process by publication in the
manner provided by chapter 49, Florida Statutes. The clerk of the circuit court
must mail a copy of the notice to the party’s last known address.
(3) For constructive service of process in all other cases, an
affidavit of diligent search and inquiry in substantial conformity with Florida
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.913(b), must be filed.
(f) Domestic, Repeat, Dating, and Sexual Violence, and Stalking
Proceedings. This rule does not govern service of process in proceedings for
injunctions for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, and sexual violence, and
stalking.
(g) Copies of Initial Pleading for Persons Served. At the time of
personal service of process a copy of the initial pleading must be delivered to the
party on whom service is made. The date and hour of service must be endorsed on
the original process and all copies of it by the person making the service. The party
seeking to effect personal service must furnish the person making service with the
necessary copies. When the service is made by publication, copies of the initial
pleadings must be furnished to the clerk and mailed by the clerk with the notice of
action to all parties whose addresses are stated in the initial pleading or sworn
statement.
(h) Service of Orders. If personal service of a court order is to be made,
the original order must be filed with the clerk, who must certify or verify a copy of
it without charge. The person making service must use the certified copy instead of
the original order in the same manner as original process in making service.
(i) Fees; Service of Pleadings. The statutory compensation for making
service shall not be increased by the simultaneous delivery or mailing of the copy
of the initial pleading in conformity with this rule.
26(j) Pleading Basis. When service of process is to be made under statutes
authorizing service on nonresidents of Florida, it is sufficient to plead the basis for
service in the language of the statute without pleading the facts supporting service.
(k) process by mail.
Service of Process by Mail. A respondent may accept service of
(1) Acceptance of service of a petition by mail does not waive any
objection to the venue or to the jurisdiction of the court over the person of the
respondent.
(2) A petitioner may notify any respondent of the commencement
of the action and request that the respondent waive service of a summons. The
notice and request must:
(A) be in writing and be addressed directly to the respondent,
if an individual, or to an officer or managing or general agent of the respondent, or
other agent authorized by appointment or law to receive service of process;
(B) be dispatched by certified mail, return receipt requested;
(C) be accompanied by a copy of the petition and must
identify the court in which it has been filed;
(D) inform the respondent of the consequences of compliance
and of failure to comply with the request;
(E) state the date on which the request is sent;
(F) allow the respondent 20 days from the date on which the
request is received to return the waiver, or, if the address of the respondent is
outside of the United States, 30 days from the date on which it is received to return
the waiver; and
(G) provide the respondent with an extra copy of the notice
and request, including the waiver, as well as a prepaid means of compliance in
writing.
(3) If a respondent fails to comply with a request for waiver within
the time provided herein, the court may impose the costs subsequently incurred in
effecting service on the respondent unless good cause for the failure is shown.
27(4) A respondent who, before being served with process, timely
returns a waiver so requested is not required to respond to the petition until 60 days
after the date the respondent received the request for waiver of service. For
purposes of computing any time prescribed or allowed by these rules, service of
process will be deemed effected 20 days before the time required to respond to the
petition.
(5) When the petitioner files a waiver of service with the court, the
action must proceed, except as provided in subdivision (k)(4) above, as if a
summons and petition had been served at the time of filing the waiver, and no
further proof of service shall be required.
(l) Summons; Time Limit. If service of the initial process and initial
pleading is not made upon a respondent within 120 days after filing of the initial
pleading directed to that respondent, the court, on its own initiative after notice or
on motion, must direct that service be effected within a specified time or must
dismiss the action without prejudice or drop that respondent as a party; provided
that if the petitioner shows good cause or excusable neglect for the failure, the
court shall extend the time for service for an appropriate period. When a motion for
leave to amend with the attached proposed amended petition is filed, the 120-day
period for service of amended petitions on the new party or parties must begin
upon the entry of an order granting leave to amend. A dismissal under this
subdivision shall not be considered a voluntary dismissal or operate as an
adjudication on the merits under rule 12.420(a)(1).
RULE 12.071. CONSTITUTIONAL CHALLENGE TO STATE
STATUTE OR COUNTY OR MUNICIAPL CHARTER,
ORDINANCE, OR FRANCHISE; NOTICE BY PARTY.
A party that files a pleading, written motion, or other document drawing into
question the constitutionality of a state statute or a county or municipal charter,
ordinance, or franchise must promptly
(a) file a notice of constitutional question stating the question and
identifying the document that raises it; and
(b) serve the notice and the pleading, written motion, or other document
drawing into question the constitutionality of a state statute or a county or
municipal charter, ordinance, or franchise on the Attorney General or the state
attorney of the judicial circuit in which the action is pending, by either certified or
registered mail.
28Service of the notice and pleading, written motion, or other document does
not require joinder of the Attorney General or the state attorney as a party to the
action.
RULE 12.080. SERVICE OF PLEADINGS AND FILING OF
DOCUMENTS
(1) Family Law Actions Generally. Service of pleadings and
documents after commencement of all family law actions, except proceedings for
injunctions for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, and sexual violence, and
stalking is as set forth in Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516, except that
rule 2.516 also applies to service on the party during the attorney’s limited
appearance as provided in rule 12.040(f) and must be expanded as set forth in
subdivisions (b) and (c) to include additional requirements for service of
recommended orders and for service on defaulted parties.
(2) Domestic, Repeat, Dating, and Sexual Violence, and
Stalking Actions. Service of pleadings and documents regarding proceedings for
injunctions against domestic, repeat, dating, and sexual violence, and stalking is
governed by rule 12.610, where it is in conflict with this rule.
(b) Service and Preparation of Orders and Judgments. A copy of all
orders or judgments involving family law matters, except proceedings for
injunctions for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, and sexual violence, and
stalking, must be transmitted by the court or under its direction to all parties at the
time of entry of the order or judgment. The court may require that recommended
orders, orders, or judgments be prepared by a party. If the court requires that a
party prepare the recommended order, order, or judgment, the party must furnish
the court with stamped, addressed envelopes to all parties for service of the
recommended order, order, or judgment. The court may also require that any
proposed recommended order, order, or judgment that is prepared by a party be
furnished to all parties no less than 24 hours before submission to the court of the
recommended order, order, or judgment.
(c) Defaulted Parties. No service need be made on parties against whom
a default has been entered, except that:
(1) Pleadings asserting new or additional claims against defaulted
parties must be served in the manner provided for service of summons contained in
rule 12.070.
29(2) Notice of final hearings or trials and court orders must be
served on defaulted parties in the manner provided for service of pleadings and
documents contained in Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
(3) Final judgments must be served on defaulted parties as set forth
in Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516(h).
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule provides that the procedure for service shall be as
set forth in Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.080 with the following exceptions or
additions to that rule. First, subdivision (b) corresponds to and replaces subdivision
(h)(1) of rule 1.080 and expands the rule to include recommended orders. Second,
this rule expands items that must be served on defaulted parties to ensure that
defaulted parties are at least minimally advised of the progress of the proceedings.
This rule is not intended to require the furnishing of a proposed recommended
order, proposed order, or proposed final judgment to a defaulted party.
Committee Notes
2012 Amendment. Subdivision (a)(1) is amended to provide for service on
the party during the attorney’s limited appearance. Subdivision[s] (a)(1), (c)(2),
and (c)(3) are amended to provide for service in accordance with Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.516.
RULE 12.090. TIME
(a) Computation. Computation of time shall be governed by Florida
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.514.
(b) Enlargement. When an act is required or allowed to be done at or
within a specified time by order of court, by these rules, or by notice given
thereunder, for cause shown the court at any time in its discretion (1) with or
without notice, may order the period enlarged if a request is made before the
expiration of the period originally prescribed or as extended by a previous order, or
(2) on motion made and notice after the expiration of the specified period, may
permit the act to be done when failure to act was the result of excusable neglect.
However, the court may not extend the time for making a motion for new trial, for
rehearing, or to alter or amend a judgment, making a motion for relief from a
judgment under rule 12.540(b), taking an appeal or filing a petition for certiorari,
or making a motion for a directed verdict.
30(c) For Motions. A copy of any written motion which may not be heard
ex parte and a copy of the notice of the hearing on the written motion must be
served a reasonable time before the time specified for the hearing.
Committee Notes
2012 Amendment. The rule is amended to treat e-mail service as service by
mail for the computation of time in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial
Administration 2.516(b)(1)(D)(iii).
RULE 12.100. PLEADINGS AND MOTIONS
(a) Pleadings. There must be a petition or, when so designated by a
statute or rule, a complaint, and a response or answer to it; a response or answer to
a counterclaim denominated as such; an answer to a crossclaim if the answer
contains a crossclaim; a third-party petition if a person who was not an original
party is summoned as a third-party respondent or defendant; and a third-party
response or answer if a third-party complaint is served. If a response or answer
contains an affirmative defense and the opposing party seeks to avoid it, the
opposing party shall file a reply containing the avoidance. In a post-judgment case,
there are a supplemental petition and a response or an answer and a counter-
supplemental petition and a response or an answer to it, if applicable. In those
cases in which there is a related civil action that is not otherwise specifically
addressed in the Family Law Rules of Procedure, then the Rules of Civil Procedure
governs those pleadings. No other pleadings are allowed unless otherwise provided
by law.
(b) Motions. An application to the court for an order must be by motion
which must be made in writing unless made during a hearing or trial, must state
with particularity the grounds therefor, and must set forth the relief or order sought.
The requirement of writing is fulfilled if the motion is stated in a written notice of
the hearing of the motion. All notices of hearings must specify each motion or
other matter to be heard.
(c) Caption.
(1) Every pleading, motion, order, judgment, or other document
must have a caption containing the name of the court, the file number, and except
for in rem proceedings, the name of the first party on each side with an appropriate
indication of other parties, and a designation identifying the party filing it and its
nature or the nature of the order, as the case may be. In any in rem proceeding,
31every pleading, motion, order, judgment, or other document must have a caption
containing the name of the court, the file number, the style “In re” (followed by the
name or general description of the property), and a designation of the person or
entity filing it and its nature or the nature of the order. All documents filed in the
action must be styled in such a manner as to indicate clearly the subject matter of
the document and the party requesting or obtaining relief. Specific captions for
family law cases are as follows:
(A) Matters Arising From Dissolution of Marriage.
(i) Original Dissolution of Marriage: In re the
Marriage of .........., Husband and .........., Wife, regardless of who files first and
whether there is a counter-petition.
(ii) Modification of Final Judgment of Dissolution of
Marriage: In the Former Marriage of .........., Former Husband, and .........., Former
Wife, regardless of who files first and whether there is a supplemental counter-
petition.
(B) Annulment.
(i) Original Annulment: In re the Marriage of ..........,
Husband and .........., Wife, regardless of who files first and whether a counter-
petition for annulment or any other pleading in the alternative for dissolution of
marriage is filed.
(ii) Supplemental or Enforcement Proceedings. The
caption must remain the same, regardless of whether an annulment or a dissolution
of marriage was ultimately granted in the original proceeding.
(C) Support Unconnected With Dissolution of Marriage: In
re the Marriage of .........., Husband and .........., Wife, regardless of who files first
and whether there is a counter-petition.
(D) Paternity.
(i) Original Paternity Proceeding when Paternity is
not Admitted Before Filing: .........., Putative Father, and .........., Mother, regardless
of who files first and whether there is a counter-petition.
32(ii) Original Paternity Proceedings when Paternity has
been Admitted Before Filing: .........., Father, and .........., Mother, regardless of who
files first and whether there is a counter-petition.
(iii) Paternity Modification: .........., Father, and ..........,
Mother, regardless of who files the supplemental petition and whether there is a
supplemental counter-petition.
(iv) Disestablishment of Paternity Proceeding: ..........,
Father, and .........., Mother.
(E) Proceedings for Temporary or Concurrent Custody of
Minor Children by Extended Family: In the interest of .........., Child(ren).
(F) Adoption.
(i) In re: Termination of Parental Rights for Proposed
Adoption of .....(name on child’s birth certificate)....., Minor Child(ren).
(ii) In re: Adoption of .....(name to be given
child(ren))....., Adoptee(s).
(iii) Stepparent Adoption Proceedings: In re: the

Support Program ex rel. .........., Petitioner, and .........., Respondent.
(I) In all supplemental proceedings for modification or
actions to enforce, the caption must remain the same as indicated in this rule.
(2) Trial level nomenclature used in the caption should be simple,
clear, constant, and, to the extent possible, unchanging, regardless of who files a
petition, counter-petition, or a supplemental action. The trial level nomenclature
expressed herein is intended to meaningfully identify the parties by role, such as
Wife, Husband, Former Wife, Former Husband, Putative Father, Father, and
Mother. Information as to who files a pleading or motion should be part of the
document rather than in the caption of the case.
33(3) A cover sheet for family court cases (form 12.928) must be
completed and filed with the clerk at the time a complaint or petition is filed by the
party initiating the action. If the cover sheet is not filed, the clerk must accept the
complaint or petition for filing; but all proceedings in the action must be abated
until a properly executed cover sheet is completed and filed. The clerk must
complete the cover sheet for a party appearing pro se.
(4) A final disposition form (form 12.999) must be filed with the
clerk at the time of the filing of the order or judgment which disposes of the action.
If the action is settled without a court order or judgment being entered, or
dismissed by the parties, the plaintiff or petitioner must immediately file a final
disposition form with the clerk. The clerk must complete the final disposition form
for a party appearing pro se, or when the action is dismissed by court order for lack
of prosecution under rule 12.420(d).
(d) Notice of Related Cases. A notice of related cases, form 12.900(h),
must be filed in conformity with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.545(d).
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule provides that pleadings and motions are to be
governed by Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.100. The cover sheets and
disposition forms described in that rule shall be the same cover sheets and
disposition forms used in family law proceedings.
RULE 12.105. SIMPLIFIED DISSOLUTION PROCEDURE
(a) Requirements for Use. The parties to the dissolution may file a
petition for simplified dissolution if they certify under oath that
(1) the parties do not have any minor or dependent children
together, the wife does not have any minor or dependent children who were born
during the marriage, and the wife is not now pregnant;
(2) the parties have made a satisfactory division of their property
and have agreed as to payment of their joint obligations; and
(3) the other facts set forth in Florida Family Law Rules of
Procedure Form 12.901(a) (Petition for Simplified Dissolution of Marriage) are
true.
34(b) Consideration by Court. The clerk shall submit the petition to the
court. The court shall consider the cause expeditiously. The parties shall appear
before the court in every case and, if the court so directs, testify. The court, after
examination of the petition and personal appearance of the parties, shall enter a
judgment granting the dissolution (Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form
12.990(a)) if the requirements of this rule have been established and there has been
compliance with the waiting period required by statute.
(c) Final Judgment. Upon the entry of the judgment, the clerk shall
furnish to each party a certified copy of the final judgment of dissolution, which
shall be in substantially the form provided in Florida Family Law Rules of
Procedure Form 12.990(a).
(d) Forms. The clerk or family law intake personnel shall provide forms
for the parties whose circumstances meet the requirements of this rule and shall
assist in the preparation of the petition for dissolution and other papers to be filed
in the action.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule was previously contained in Florida Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.611, which included several unrelated issues. Those issues are now
governed by separate family law rules for automatic disclosure, central
governmental depository, and this rule for simplified dissolution procedure. Under
this rule, the parties must file a financial affidavit (Florida Family Law Rules of
Procedure Form 12.902(b) or 12.902(c)), depending on their income and expenses)
and a marital settlement agreement (Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form
12.902(f)(3)).
RULE 12.110. GENERAL RULES OF PLEADING
(a) Forms of Pleadings. Forms of action and technical forms for seeking
relief and of pleas, pleadings, or motions are abolished.
(b) Claims for Relief. A pleading which sets forth a claim for relief,
whether an original petition, counterpetition, counterclaim, crossclaim, or third-
party claim, must state a cause of action and must contain
(1) a short and plain statement of the grounds on which the court’s
jurisdiction depends, unless the court already has jurisdiction and the pleading
needs no new grounds of jurisdiction to support it,
35(2) a short and plain statement of both the relief requested and the
ultimate facts showing that the pleader is entitled to that relief, and
(3) deems himself or herself entitled.
a demand for judgment for the relief to which the pleader
Relief in the alternative or of several different types may be demanded.
Every petition shall be considered to pray for general relief.
(c) The Answer. In the answer a pleader must state in short and plain
terms the pleader’s answers to each claim asserted and must admit or deny the
allegations on which the adverse party relies. If the pleader is without knowledge,
he or she must so state and such statement operates as a denial. Denial must fairly
meet the substance of the allegations denied. When a pleader intends in good faith
to deny only a part of an allegation, the pleader must specify so much of it as is
true and must deny the remainder. Unless the pleader intends in good faith to
controvert all of the allegations of the preceding pleading, the pleader may make
denials as specific denials of designated allegations or may generally deny all of
the allegations except such designated allegations as the pleader expressly admits.
However, when the pleader does so intend to controvert all of its allegations,
including allegations of the grounds on which the court’s jurisdiction depends, the
pleader may do so by general denial.
(d) Affirmative Defenses. In the answer a party must state affirmatively
any matter constituting an avoidance or affirmative defense or any other
affirmative defense as allowed by law. When a party has mistakenly designated a
defense as a counterclaim or a counterclaim as a defense, the court, on terms if
justice so requires, must treat the pleading as if there had been a proper
designation. Affirmative defenses appearing on the face of a prior pleading may be
asserted as grounds for a motion or defense under rule 12.140, provided this shall
not limit amendments under rule 12.190 even if such grounds are sustained.
(e) Effect of Failure to Deny. Allegations in a pleading to which a
responsive pleading is required, other than those as to the relief requested, are
admitted when not denied in the responsive pleading. Allegations in a pleading to
which no responsive pleading is required or permitted must be taken as denied or
avoided.
(f) Separate Statements. All allegations of claim or defense must be
made in consecutively numbered paragraphs, the contents of each of which must
be limited as far as practicable to a statement of a single set of circumstances, and a
36paragraph may be referred to by number in all subsequent pleadings. Each claim
founded upon a separate transaction or occurrence and each defense other than
denials must be stated in a separate count or response when a separation facilitates
the clear presentation of the matter set forth.
(g) Joinder of Causes of Action; Consistency. A pleader may set up in
the same action as many claims or causes of action or defenses in the same right as
the pleader has, and claims for relief may be stated in the alternative if separate
items make up the cause of action, or if 2 or more causes of action are joined. A
party may also set forth 2 or more statements of a claim or defense alternatively,
either in 1 count or defense or in separate counts or defenses. When 2 or more
statements are made in the alternative and 1 of them, if made independently, would
be sufficient, the pleading is not made insufficient by the insufficiency of 1 or
more of the alternative statements. A party may also state as many separate claims
or defenses as that party has, regardless of consistency and whether based on legal
or equitable grounds or both. All pleadings must be construed so as to do
substantial justice.
(h) Subsequent Pleadings. When the nature of an action permits
pleadings subsequent to final judgment and the jurisdiction of the court over the
parties has not terminated, the initial pleading subsequent to final judgment must
be designated a supplemental petition. The action must then proceed in the same
manner and time as though the supplemental petition were the initial pleading in
the action, including the issuance of any needed process. Proceedings to modify a
final judgment must be initiated only under this subdivision and not by motion.
This subdivision does not apply to proceedings that may be initiated by motion
under these rules.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule clarifies that final judgment modifications must be
initiated pursuant to a supplemental petition as set forth in rule 1.110(h), rather
than through a motion. Rule 1.110(h) is to be interpreted to require service of
process on a supplemental petition as set forth in Florida Family Law Rule of
Procedure 12.070.
RULE 12.120. PLEADING SPECIAL MATTERS
(a) Capacity. Unless required by statute, it is not necessary to allege the
capacity of a party to sue or be sued, the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a
representative capacity, or the legal existence of an organized association of
37persons that is made a party, except to the extent required to show the jurisdiction
of the court. The initial pleading served on behalf of a minor party must
specifically allege the age of the minor party. When a party desires to raise an issue
as to the legal existence of any party, the capacity of any party to sue or be sued, or
the authority of a party to sue or be sued in a representative capacity, that party
must do so by specific negative allegation(s) which must include such supporting
particulars as are peculiarly within the pleader’s knowledge.
(b) Fraud; Mistake; Condition of the Mind. In all allegations of fraud
or mistake, the circumstances constituting fraud or mistake must be stated with
such particularity as the circumstances may permit. Malice, intent, knowledge,
mental attitude, and other condition of mind of a person may be alleged generally.
(c) Conditions Precedent. In pleading the performance or occurrence of
conditions precedent, it is sufficient to allege generally that all conditions
precedent have been performed or have occurred. A denial of performance or
occurrence must be made specifically and with particularity.
(d) Official Document or Act. In pleading an official document or
official act it is sufficient to allege that the document was issued or the act done in
compliance with law.
(e) Judgment or Decree. In pleading a judgment or decree of a domestic
or foreign court, a judicial or quasi-judicial tribunal, or a board or officer, it is
sufficient to allege the judgment or decree without setting forth matter showing
jurisdiction to render it.
(f) Time and Place. For the purpose of testing the sufficiency of a
pleading, allegations of time and place are material and must be considered like all
other allegations of material matter.
(g) Special Damage. When items of special damage are claimed, they
must be specifically stated.
RULE 12.130. DOCUMENTS SUPPORTING ACTION OR DEFENSE
(a) Documents Attached. If it is essential to state a cause of action, a
copy of the bonds, notes, bills of exchange, contracts, accounts, or other documents
or the relevant portions of the documents shall be incorporated in or attached to the
pleadings.
38(b) Part for All Purposes. Any exhibit attached to a pleading shall be
considered part of the pleading. Statements in a pleading may be adopted by
reference in a different part of the same pleading, in another pleading, or in any
motion.
(c) Protection of Account and Personal Identifying Numbers. Any
reference in any pleading or exhibit filed with the court to account numbers, social
security numbers, employee identification numbers, driver’s license numbers,
passport numbers, or other personal identifying information shall be presented as
provided in Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425.
RULE 12.140. RESPONSES
(a) When Presented.
(1) Unless a different time is prescribed in a statute of Florida, a
respondent must serve a response within 20 days after service of original process
and the initial pleading on the respondent, or not later than the date fixed in a
notice by publication. The petitioner must serve a response to a counterpetition
within 20 days after service of the counterpetition. If a reply is required, the reply
must be served within 20 days after service of the response. A party served with a
pleading stating a crosspetition against that party must serve a response to it within
20 days after service on that party.
(2) The service of a motion under this rule, except a motion for
judgment on the pleadings or a motion to strike under subdivision (f), alters these
periods of time so that if the court denies the motion or postpones its disposition
until the trial on the merits, the responsive pleadings must be served within 10 days
after notice of the court’s action or, if the court grants a motion for a more definite
statement, the responsive pleadings must be served within 10 days after service of
the more definite statement unless a different time is fixed by the court in either
case.
(3) If the court permits or requires an amended or responsive
pleading or a more definite statement, the pleading or statement must be served
within 10 days after notice of the court’s action. Responses to the pleadings or
statements must be served within 10 days of service of such pleadings or
statements.
39(b) How Presented. Every defense in law or fact to a claim for relief in a
pleading must be asserted in the responsive pleading, if one is required, but the
following responses may be made by motion at the option of the pleader:
(1) lack of jurisdiction over the subject matter;
(2) lack of jurisdiction over the person;
(3) improper venue;
(4) insufficiency of process;
(5) insufficiency of service of process;
(6) failure to state a cause of action; and
(7) failure to join indispensable parties.
A motion making any of these responses must be made before pleading if a
further pleading is permitted. The grounds on which any of the enumerated
responses are based and the substantial matters of law intended to be argued must
be stated specifically and with particularity in the responsive pleading or motion.
Any ground not stated must be deemed to be waived except any ground showing
that the court lacks jurisdiction of the subject matter may be made at any time. No
response or objection is waived by being joined with other responses or objections
in a responsive pleading or motion. If a pleading sets forth a claim for relief to
which the adverse party is not required to serve a responsive pleading, the adverse
party may assert any defense in law or fact to that claim for relief at the trial,
except that the objection of failure to state a legal defense in an answer or reply
must be asserted by motion to strike the defense within 20 days after service of the
answer or reply.
(c) Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. After the pleadings are
closed, but within such time as not to delay the trial, any party may move for
judgment on the pleadings.
(d) Preliminary Hearings. The responses in subdivisions (b)(1)–(b)(7),
whether made in a pleading or by motion, and the motion for judgment in
subdivision (c) must be heard and determined before trial on application of any
party unless the court orders that the hearing and determination will be deferred
until the trial.
40(e) Motion for More Definite Statement. If a pleading to which a
responsive pleading is permitted is so vague or ambiguous that a party cannot
reasonably be required to frame a responsive pleading, that party may move for a
more definite statement before interposing a responsive pleading. The motion must
point out the defects complained of and the details desired. If the motion is granted
and the order of the court is not obeyed within 10 days after notice of the order or
such other time as the court may fix, the court may strike the pleading to which the
motion was directed or make such order as it deems just.
(f) Motion to Strike. A party may move to strike or the court may strike
redundant, immaterial, impertinent, or scandalous matter from any pleading at any
time.
(g) Consolidation of Responses. A party who makes a motion under this
rule may join with it the other motions herein provided for and then available to
that party. If a party makes a motion under this rule but omits from it any responses
or objections then available to that party that this rule permits to be raised by
motion, that party shall not thereafter make a motion based on any of the responses
or objections omitted, except as provided in subdivision (h)(2).
(h) Waiver of Responses.
(1) A party waives all responses and objections that the party does
not present either by motion under subdivisions (b), (e), or (f) or, if the party has
made no motion, in a responsive pleading except as provided in subdivision (h)(2).
(2) The responses of failure to state a cause of action or a legal
defense or to join an indispensable party may be raised by motion for judgment on
the pleadings or at the trial on the merits in addition to being raised either in a
motion under subdivision (b) or in the answer or reply. The defense of lack of
jurisdiction of the subject matter may be raised at any time.
RULE 12.150. SHAM PLEADINGS
(a) Motion to Strike. If a party deems any pleading or part of it filed by
another party to be a sham, that party may move to strike the pleading or part of it
before the cause is set for trial and the court must hear the motion, taking evidence
of the respective parties, and if the motion is sustained, the pleading to which the
motion is directed must be stricken. Default and summary judgment on the merits
may be entered in the discretion of the court or the court may permit additional
pleadings to be filed for good cause shown.
41(b) affidavit.
Contents of Motion. The motion to strike must be verified and must
set forth fully the facts on which the movant relies and may be supported by
RULE 12.160. MOTIONS
All motions for the issuance of process and to enforce and execute
judgments, for entering defaults, and for such other proceedings in the clerk’s
office not requiring an order of court must be deemed grantable as of course by the
clerk. The clerk’s action may be suspended, altered, or rescinded by the court upon
good cause shown.
RULE 12.170. COUNTERPETITTIONS AND CROSSCLAIMS
(a) Compulsory Counterpetitions. A pleading must state as a
counterpetition any claim which at the time of serving the pleading the pleader has
against any opposing party, provided it arises out of the transaction or occurrence
that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim and does not require for its
adjudication the presence of third parties over whom the court cannot acquire
jurisdiction. But the pleader need not state a claim if (1) at the time the action was
commenced the claim was the subject of another pending action, or (2) the
opposing party brought suit upon that party’s claim by attachment or other process
by which the court did not acquire jurisdiction to render a personal judgment on
the claim and the pleader is not stating a counterpetition under this rule.
(b) Permissive Counterpetition. A pleading may state as a
counterpetition any claim against an opposing party not arising out of the
transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the opposing party’s claim.
(c) Counterclaim Exceeding Opposing Claim. A counterclaim may or
may not diminish or defeat the recovery sought by the opposing party. It may claim
relief exceeding in amount or different in kind from that sought in the pleading of
the opposing party.
(d) Counterclaim Against the State. These rules shall not be construed
to enlarge beyond the limits established by law the right to assert counterclaims or
to claim credits against the state or any of its subdivisions or other governmental
organizations of the state subject to suit or against a municipal corporation or
against an officer, agency, or administrative board of the state.
42(e) Counterclaim Maturing or Acquired after Pleading. A claim
which matured or was acquired by the pleader after serving the pleading may be
presented as a counterpetition by supplemental pleading with the permission of the
court.
(f) Omitted Counterclaim or Crossclaim. When a pleader fails to set
up a counterclaim or crossclaim through oversight, inadvertence, or excusable
neglect, or when justice or equity requires, the pleader may set up the counterclaim
or crossclaim by amendment with leave of the court.
(g) Crossclaim Against Co-Party. A pleading may state as a crossclaim
any claim by one party against a co-party arising out of the transaction or
occurrence that is the subject matter of either the original action or a counterclaim
within the original action, or relating to any property that is the subject matter of
the original action. The crossclaim may include a claim that the party against
whom it is asserted is or may be liable to the crossclaimant for all or part of a claim
asserted in the action against the crossclaimant. Service of a crossclaim on a party
who has appeared in the action must be made under rule 12.080. Service of a
crossclaim against a party who has not appeared in the action must be made in the
manner provided for service of summons.
(h) Additional Parties May Be Brought In. When the presence of
parties other than those to the original action is required to grant complete relief in
the determination of a counterclaim or crossclaim, they must be named in the
counterpetition or crossclaim and be served with process and will be parties to the
action thereafter if jurisdiction of them can be obtained and their joinder will not
deprive the court of jurisdiction of the action. Rules 12.250(b) and (c) apply to
parties brought in under this subdivision.
(i) Separate Trials; Separate Judgment. If the court orders separate
trials, a judgment on a counterclaim or crossclaim may be rendered when the court
has jurisdiction to do so even if a claim of the opposing party has been dismissed
or otherwise disposed of.
Committee Notes
2012 Amendment. This rule is amended to provide for service in
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
43RULE 12.180. THIRD-PARTY PRACTICE
(a) When Available. At any time after commencement of the action a
respondent may have a summons and petition served on a person not a party to the
action who is or may be liable to the respondent for all or part of the petitioner’s
claim against the respondent, and may also assert any other claim that arises out of
the transaction or occurrence that is the subject matter of the petitioner’s claim.
The respondent need not obtain leave of court if the respondent files the third-party
complaint not later than 20 days after the respondent serves the original answer.
Otherwise, the respondent must obtain leave on motion and notice to all parties to
the action. The person served with the summons and third-party complaint, the
third-party respondent, must make defenses to the respondent’s claim as provided
in rules 12.110 and 12.140 and counterpetitions against the respondent and
crossclaims against other third-party respondents as provided in rule 12.170. The
third-party respondent may assert against the petitioner any defenses that the
respondent has to the petitioner’s claim.
(b) Additional Claims. The third-party respondent may also assert any
claim against the petitioner arising out of the transaction or occurrence that is the
subject matter of the petitioner’s claim against the respondent. The petitioner may
assert any claim against the third-party respondent arising out of the transaction or
occurrence that is the subject matter of the petitioner’s claim against the
respondent, and the third-party respondent must assert a defense as provided in
rules 12.110 and 12.140 and counterpetitions and crossclaims as provided in rule
12.170. Any party may move to strike the third-party claim or for its severance or
separate trial. A third-party respondent may proceed under this rule against any
person not a party to the action who is or may be liable to the third-party
respondent for all or part of the claim made in the action against the third-party
respondent.
(c) When Petitioner May Bring in Third Party. When a counterpetition
is asserted against the petitioner, the petitioner may bring in a third party under
circumstances which would entitle a respondent to do so under this rule.
RULE 12.190. AMENDED PLEADINGS
(a) Amendments. A party may amend a pleading once as a matter of
course at any time before a responsive pleading is served or, if the pleading is one
to which no responsive pleading is permitted and the action has not been placed on
the trial calendar, may so amend it at any time within 20 days after it is served.
44Otherwise a party may amend a pleading only by leave of court or by written
consent of the adverse party. If a party files a motion to amend a pleading, the
party must attach the proposed amended pleading to the motion. Leave of court
shall be given freely when justice so requires. A party must plead in response to an
amended pleading within 10 days after service of the amended pleading unless the
court otherwise orders.
(b) Amendments to Conform with the Evidence. When issues not
raised by the pleadings are tried by express or implied consent of the parties, they
will be treated in all respects as if they had been raised in the pleadings. Such
amendment of the pleadings as may be necessary to cause them to conform to the
evidence and to raise these issues may be made upon motion of any party at any
time, even after judgment, but failure so to amend will not affect the result of the
trial of these issues. If the evidence is objected to at the trial on the ground that it is
not within the issues made by the pleadings, the court may allow the pleadings to
be amended to conform with the evidence and must do so freely when the merits of
the cause are more effectually presented thereby and the objecting party fails to
satisfy the court that the admission of such evidence will prejudice the objecting
party in maintaining an action or defense upon the merits.
(c) Relation Back of Amendments. When the claim or defense asserted
in the amended pleading arose out of the conduct, transaction, or occurrence set
forth or attempted to be set forth in the original pleading, the amendment must
relate back to the date of the original pleading.
(d) Amendments Generally. At any time in furtherance of justice, upon
such terms as may be just, the court may permit any process, proceeding, pleading,
or record to be amended or material supplemental matter to be set forth in an
amended or supplemental pleading. At every stage of the action the court must
disregard any error or defect in the proceedings that does not affect the substantial
rights of the parties.
RULE 12.200. CASE MANAGEMENT AND PRETRIAL
CONFERENCES
(a) Case Management Conference.
(1) Family Law Proceedings, Generally. A case management
conference may be ordered by the court at any time on the court’s initiative. A
party may request a case management conference 30 days after service of a petition
or complaint. At such a conference the court may:
45(A) and other documents;
(B) (C) schedule or reschedule the service of motions, pleadings,
set or reset the time of trials, subject to rule 12.440;
coordinate the progress of the action if complex litigation
factors are present;
(D) limit, schedule, order, or expedite discovery;
(E) schedule disclosure of expert witnesses and the discovery
of facts known and opinions held by such experts;
(F) schedule or hear motions related to admission or
exclusion of evidence;
(G) pursue the possibilities of settlement;
(H) require filing of preliminary stipulations if issues can be
narrowed;
(I) refer issues to a magistrate for findings of fact, if consent
is obtained as provided in rules 12.490 and 12.492 and if no significant history of
domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking that would compromise the
process is involved in the case;
(J) refer the parties to mediation if no significant history of
domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking that would compromise the
mediation process is involved in the case and consider allocation of expenses
related to the referral; or refer the parties to counseling if no significant history of
domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence or stalking that would compromise the
process is involved in the case and consider allocation of expenses related to the
referral;
(K) coordinate voluntary binding arbitration consistent with
Florida law if no significant history of domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence
or stalking that would compromise the process is involved in the case;
(L) appoint court experts and allocate the expenses for the
appointments;
46(M) refer the cause for a parenting plan recommendation,
social investigation and study, home study, or psychological evaluation and
allocate the initial expense for that study;
(N) appoint an attorney or guardian ad litem for a minor child
or children if required and allocate the expense of the appointment;
(O) schedule other conferences or determine other matters
that may aid in the disposition of the action; and
(P) consider any agreements, objections, or form of
production of electronically stored information.
(2) Adoption Proceedings. A case management conference shall
be ordered by the court within 60 days of the filing of a petition when
(A) there is a request for a waiver of consent to a termination
of parental rights of any person required to consent by section 63.062, Florida
Statutes;
(B) notice of the hearing on the petition to terminate parental
rights pending adoption is not being afforded a person whose consent is required
but who has not consented;
(C) there is an objection to venue, which was made after the
waiver of venue was signed;
(D) an intermediary, attorney, or agency is seeking fees,
costs, or other expenses in excess of those provided under section 63.097 or
63.212(5), Florida Statutes;
(E) an affidavit of diligent search and inquiry is filed in lieu
of personal service under section 63.088(4), Florida Statutes; or
(F) the court is otherwise aware that any person having
standing objects to the termination of parental rights pending adoption.
(b) Pretrial Conference. After the action is at issue the court itself may
or shall on the timely motion of any party require the parties to appear for a
conference to consider and determine:
47(1) proposed stipulations and the simplification of the issues;
(2) the necessity or desirability of amendments to the pleadings;
(3) that will avoid unnecessary proof;
the possibility of obtaining admissions of fact and of documents
(4) the limitation of the number of expert witnesses; and
(5) any matters permitted under subdivision (a) of this rule.
(c) Notice. Reasonable notice shall be given for a case management
conference, and 20 days’ notice shall be given for a pretrial conference. On failure
of a party to attend a conference, the court may dismiss the action, strike the
pleadings, limit proof or witnesses, or take any other appropriate action. Any
documents that the court requires for any conference shall be specified in the order.
Orders setting pretrial conferences shall be uniform throughout the territorial
jurisdiction of the court.
(d) Case Management and Pretrial Order. The court shall make an
order reciting the action taken at a conference and any stipulations made. The order
shall control the subsequent course of the action unless modified to prevent
injustice.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule addresses issues raised by decisions such as
Dralus v. Dralus, 627 So.2d 505 (Fla. 2d DCA 1993); Wrona v. Wrona, 592 So.2d
694 (Fla. 2d DCA 1991); and Katz v. Katz, 505 So.2d 25 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987),
regarding the cost of marital litigation. This rule provides an orderly method for
the just, speedy, and inexpensive determination of issues and promotes amicable
resolution of disputes.
This rule replaces and substantially expands Florida Rule of Civil Procedure
1.200 as it pertained to family law matters. Under this rule, a court may convene a
case management conference at any time and a party may request a case
management conference 30 days after service of a petition or complaint. The court
may consider the following additional items at the conference: motions related to
admission or exclusion of evidence, referral of issues to a master if consent is
obtained pursuant to the rules, referral of the parties to mediation, referral of the
parties to counseling, coordination of voluntary binding arbitration, appointment of
48court experts, referral of the cause for a home study psychological evaluation, and
appointment of an attorney or guardian ad litem for a minor child.
Committee Note
1997 Amendment. In In re Adoption of Baby E.A.W., 658 So.2d 961 (Fla.
1995), and other cases involving protracted adoption litigation, it becomes clear
that the earlier the issue of notice is decided by the court, the earlier the balance of
the issues can be litigated. Because both parents’ constitutional standing and
guarantees of due process require notice and an opportunity to be heard, this rule
amendment will help solve the problems of adoption litigation lasting until a
child’s third, fourth, or even fifth birthday. Furthermore, this rule will encourage
both parents to be more candid with intermediaries and attorneys involved in the
adoption process.
In E.A.W., 658 So.2d at 979, Justice Kogan, concurring in part and
dissenting in part, stated: “I personally urge the Family Law Rules Committee . . .
to study possible methods of expediting review of disputes between biological and
adoptive parents.” This rule expedites resolution of preliminary matters concerning
due process in difficult adoption disputes. This rule also mandates early
consideration of the child’s rights to due process at early stages of adoption
litigation.
Noncompliance with subdivision (a)(2) of this rule shall not invalidate an
otherwise valid adoption.
RULE 12.210. PARTIES
(a) Parties Generally. Every action may be prosecuted in the name of the
real party in interest, but a personal representative, administrator, guardian, trustee
of an express trust, a party with whom or in whose name a contract has been made
for the benefit of another, or a party expressly authorized by statute may sue in that
person’s own name without joining the party for whose benefit the action is
brought. All persons having an interest in any subject of the action may be joined.
Any person may at any time be made a party if that person’s presence is necessary
or proper for a complete determination of the cause.
(b) Minors, Incapacitated, or Incompetent Persons. When a minor,
incapacitated, or incompetent person has a representative, such as a guardian or
other like fiduciary, the representative may appear in the action on behalf of the
minor, incapacitated, or incompetent person. A minor, incapacitated, or
49incompetent person who does not have a duly appointed representative may appear
by next friend or by a guardian ad litem. The court shall have the discretion to
appoint a guardian ad litem and/or attorney ad litem for a minor, incapacitated, or
incompetent person not otherwise represented in an action or shall make such other
order as it deems proper for the protection of the minor, incapacitated, or
incompetent person.
(c) Child as Party. This rule shall not be read to require that a child is an
indispensable party for a dissolution of marriage or action involving a parenting
plan.
RULE 12.230. INTERVENTIONS
Anyone claiming an interest in pending litigation may, at any time, be
permitted to assert a right by intervention, but the intervention must be in
subordination to, and in recognition of, the propriety of the main proceeding,
unless otherwise ordered by the court in its discretion.
RULE 12.240. INTERPLEADER
Persons having claims against the petitioner may be joined as parties and
required to interplead when their claims are such that the petitioner is or may be
exposed to double or multiple liability. It is not ground for objection to the joinder
that the claim of the several claimants or the titles on which their claims depend do
not have common origin or are not identical but are adverse to and independent of
one another, or it is alleged that the petitioner is not liable in whole or in part to
any or all of the claimants. A party exposed to similar liability may obtain such
interpleader by way of crossclaim or counterpetition. The provisions of this rule
supplement and do not in any way limit the joinder of parties otherwise permitted.
RULE 12.250. MISJOINDER AND NONJOINDER OF PARTIES
(a) Misjoinder. Misjoinder of parties is not a ground for dismissal of an
action. Any claim against a party may be severed and proceeded with separately.
(b) Dropping Parties. Parties may be dropped by an adverse party in the
manner provided for voluntary dismissal in rule 12.420(a)(1) subject to the
exception stated in that rule. If notice of lis pendens has been filed in the action
against a party so dropped, the notice of dismissal must be recorded and cancels
the notice of lis pendens without the necessity of a court order. Parties may be
50dropped by order of court on its own initiative or the motion of any party at any
stage of the action on such terms as are just.
(c) Adding Parties. Parties may be added once as a matter of course
within the same time that pleadings can be so amended under rule 12.190(a). If
amendment by leave of court or stipulation of the parties is permitted, parties may
be added in the amended pleading without further order of court. Parties may be
added by order of court on its own initiative or on motion of any party at any stage
of the action and on such terms as are just.
RULE 12.260. SURVIVOR; SUBSTITUTION OF PARTIES
(a) Death.
(1) If a party dies and the claim is not thereby extinguished, the
court may order substitution of the proper parties. The motion for substitution may
be made by any party or by the successors or representatives of the deceased party
and, together with the notice of hearing, must be served on all parties as provided
in rule 12.080 and on persons not parties in the manner provided for the service of
a summons. If a party dies while a proceeding is pending and that party’s rights
survive, the court may order the substitution of the proper party on its own motion
or that of any interested person.
(2) In the event of the death of one or more of the petitioners or of
one or more of the respondents in an action in which the right sought to be
enforced survives only to the surviving petitioners or only against the surviving
respondents, the action does not abate. The death shall be suggested on the record
and the action proceeds in favor of or against the surviving parties.
(b) Incapacity. If a party becomes incapacitated, the court may allow the
action to be continued by or against that person’s representative.
(c) Transfer of Interest. In case of any transfer of interest, the action
may be continued by or against the original party, unless the court upon motion
directs the person to whom the interest is transferred to be substituted in the action
or joined with the original party. Service of the motion must be made as provided
in subdivision (a).
(d) Public Officers; Death or Separation from Office.
51(1) When a public officer is a party to an action in an official
capacity and during its pendency dies, resigns, or otherwise ceases to hold office,
the action does not abate and the officer’s successor is automatically substituted as
a party. Proceedings following the substitution must be in the name of the
substituted party, but any misnomer not affecting the substantial rights of the
parties must be disregarded. An order of substitution may be entered at any time,
but the omission to enter such an order does not affect the substitution.
(2) When a public officer sues or is sued in an official capacity, the
officer may be described as a party by the official title rather than by name but the
court may require the officer’s name to be added.
RULE 12.270. CONSOLIDATION; SEPARATE TRIALS
Related cases and consolidation of cases are governed by Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.545.
RULE 12.271. CONFIDENTIALITY OF RELATED FAMILY
HEARINGS
(a) Confidentiality of Coordinated or Joint Hearings. When related
family cases are coordinated or joint hearings ordered, any hearings or proceedings
involving more than one related family case are subject to the applicable state and
federal confidentiality statutes pertaining to each case as if heard separately.
(b) No Waiver. The confidentiality of a case or issue is not waived by
coordination or a joint hearing.
RULE 12.280. GENERAL PROVISIONS GOVERNING DISCOVERY
(a) Discovery Methods. Parties may obtain discovery by 1 or more of the
following methods: depositions upon oral examination or written questions; written
interrogatories; production of documents or things or permission to enter on land
or other property for inspection and other purposes; physical and mental
examinations; and requests for admission. Unless the court orders otherwise and
under subdivision (d), the frequency of use of these methods is not limited, except
as provided in rules 12.200, 12.340, and 12.370.
(b) Redaction of Personal Information. All filings of discovery
information must comply with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425. The
court has the authority to impose sanctions for violation of this rule.
52(c) Scope of Discovery. Unless otherwise limited by order of the court in
accordance with these rules, the scope of discovery is as follows:
(1) In General. Parties may obtain discovery regarding any matter,
not privileged, that is relevant to the subject matter of the pending action, whether
it relates to the claim or defense of the party seeking discovery or the claim or
defense of any other party, including the existence, description, nature, custody,
condition, and location of any books, documents, or other tangible things and the
identity and location of persons having knowledge of any discoverable matter. It is
not grounds for objection that the information sought will be inadmissible at the
trial if the information sought appears reasonably calculated to lead to the
discovery of admissible evidence.
(2) Indemnity Agreements. A party may obtain discovery of the
existence and contents of any agreement under which any person may be liable to
satisfy part or all of a judgment that may be entered in the action or to indemnify or
to reimburse a party for payments made to satisfy the judgment.
(3) Electronically Stored Information. A party may obtain
discovery of electronically stored information in accordance with these rules.
(4) Trial Preparation: Materials. Subject to the provisions of
subdivision (c)(5), a party may obtain discovery of documents and tangible things
otherwise discoverable under subdivision (c)(1) and prepared in anticipation of
litigation or for trial by or for another party or by or for that party’s representative,
including that party’s attorney, consultant, or agent, only on a showing that the
party seeking discovery has need of the materials in the preparation of the case and
is unable without undue hardship to obtain the substantial equivalent of the
materials by other means. In ordering discovery of the materials when the required
showing has been made, the court must protect against disclosure of the mental
impressions, conclusions, opinions, or legal theories of an attorney or other
representative of a party concerning the litigation. Without the required showing a
party may obtain a copy of a statement concerning the action or its subject matter
previously made by that party. On request without the required showing a person
not a party may obtain a copy of a statement concerning the action or its subject
matter previously made by that person. If the request is refused, the person may
move for an order to obtain a copy. The provisions of rule 12.380(a)(4) apply to
the award of expenses incurred as a result of making the motion. For purposes of
this subdivision, a statement previously made is a written statement signed or
otherwise adopted or approved by the person making it, or a stenographic,
53mechanical, electrical, or other recording or transcription of it that is a substantially
verbatim recital of an oral statement by the person making it and
contemporaneously recorded.
(5) Trial Preparation: Experts. Discovery of facts known and
opinions held by experts, otherwise discoverable under the provisions of
subdivision (c)(1) and acquired or developed in anticipation of litigation or for
trial, may be obtained as follows:
(A) (i) By interrogatories a party may require any other
party to identify each person whom the other party expects to call as an expert
witness at trial and to state the subject matter on which the expert is expected to
testify, and to state the substance of the facts and opinions to which the expert is
expected to testify and a summary of the grounds for each opinion.
(ii) Any person disclosed by interrogatories or
otherwise as a person expected to be called as an expert witness at trial may be
deposed in accordance with rule 12.390 without motion or order of court.
(iii) A party may obtain the following discovery
regarding any person disclosed by interrogatories or otherwise as a person
expected to be called as an expert witness at trial:
a. The scope of employment in the pending
case and the compensation for such service.
b. The expert’s general litigation experience,
including the percentage of work performed for petitioners and respondents.
c. The identity of other cases, within a
reasonable time period, in which the expert has testified by deposition or at trial.
d. An approximation of the portion of the
expert’s involvement as an expert witness, which may be based on the number of
hours, percentage of hours, or percentage of earned income derived from serving
as an expert witness; however, the expert must not be required to disclose his or
her earnings as an expert witness or income derived from other services.
An expert may be required to produce financial and business
records only under the most unusual or compelling circumstances and may not be
compelled to compile or produce nonexistent documents. On motion, the court
54may order further discovery by other means, subject to such restrictions as to scope
and other provisions under subdivision (c)(5)(C) concerning fees and expenses as
the court may deem appropriate.
(B) A party may discover facts known or opinions held by an
expert who has been retained or specially employed by another party in
anticipation of litigation or preparation for trial and who is not expected to be
called as a witness at trial, only as provided in rule 12.360(b) or on a showing of
exceptional circumstances under which it is impracticable for the party seeking
discovery to obtain facts or opinions on the same subject by other means.
(C) Unless manifest injustice would result, the court must
require that the party seeking discovery pay the expert a reasonable fee for time
spent in responding to discovery under subdivisions (c)(5)(A) and (c)(5)(B); and
concerning discovery from an expert obtained under subdivision (c)(5)(A) the
court may require, and concerning discovery obtained under subdivision (c)(5)(B)
must require, the party seeking discovery to pay the other party a fair part of the
fees and expenses reasonably incurred by the latter party in obtaining facts and
opinions from the expert.
(D) witness as defined in rule 12.390.
As used in these rules an expert shall be an expert
(6) Claims of Privilege or Protection of Trial Preparation
Materials. When a party withholds information otherwise discoverable under
these rules by claiming that it is privileged or subject to protection as trial
preparation material, the party must make the claim expressly and must describe
the nature of the documents, communications, or things not produced or disclosed
in a manner that, without revealing information itself privileged or protected, will
enable other parties to assess the applicability of the privilege or protection.
(d) Protective Orders. On motion by a party or by the person from
whom discovery is sought, and for good cause shown, the court in which the action
is pending may make any order to protect a party or person from annoyance,
embarrassment, oppression, or undue burden or expense that justice requires,
including one or more of the following:
(1) that the discovery not be had;
(2) that the discovery may be had only on specified terms and
conditions, including a designation of the time or place;
55(3) that the discovery may be had only by a method of discovery
other than that selected by the party seeking discovery;
(4) that certain matters not be inquired into, or that the scope of the
discovery be limited to certain matters;
(5) persons designated by the court;
that the discovery be conducted with no one present except
(6) that a deposition after being sealed be opened only by order of
the court;
(7) that a trade secret or other confidential research, development,
or commercial information not be disclosed or be disclosed only in a designated
way; and
(8) that the parties simultaneously file specified documents or
information enclosed in sealed envelopes to be opened as directed by the court.
If the motion for a protective order is denied in whole or in part, the court
may, on such terms and conditions as are just, order that any party or person
provide or permit discovery. The provisions of rule 12.380(a)(4) apply to the
award of expenses incurred in relation to the motion.
(e) Limitations on Discovery of Electronically Stored Information.
(1) A person may object to discovery of electronically stored
information from sources that the person identifies as not reasonably accessible
because of burden or cost. On motion to compel discovery or for a protective
order, the person from whom the discovery is sought must show that the
information sought or the format requested is not reasonably accessible because of
undue burden or cost. If that showing is made, the court may nonetheless order the
discovery from such sources or in such formats if the requesting party shows good
cause. The court may specify conditions of the discovery, including ordering that
some or all of the expenses incurred by the person from whom discovery is sought
be paid by the party seeking discovery.
(2) In determining any motion involving discovery of electronically
stored information, the court must limit the frequency or extent of discovery
otherwise allowed by these rules if it determines that
56(A) the discovery sought is unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, or can be obtained from another source or in another manner that is
more convenient, less burdensome, or less expensive; or
(B) the burden or expense of the discovery outweighs its
likely benefit, considering the needs of the case, the amount in controversy, the
parties’ resources, the importance of the issues at stake in the action, and the
importance of the discovery in resolving the issues.
(f) Sequence and Timing of Discovery. Except as provided in
subdivision (c)(5) or unless the court upon motion for the convenience of parties
and witnesses and in the interest of justice orders otherwise, methods of discovery
may be used in any sequence, and the fact that a party is conducting discovery,
whether by deposition or otherwise, does not delay any other party’s discovery.
(g) Supplementing of Responses. A party is under a duty to amend a
prior response or disclosure if the party:
(1) obtains information or otherwise determines that the prior
response or disclosure was incorrect when made; or
(2) obtains information or otherwise determines that the prior
response or disclosure, although correct when made, is no longer materially true or
complete.
(h) Time for Serving Supplemental Responses. Any supplemental
response served under this rule must be served as soon as possible after discovery
of the incorrect information or change, but in no case may the supplemental
response be served later than 24 hours before any applicable hearing absent a
showing of good cause.
(i) Confidentiality of Records. A determination as to the confidentiality
of a court record must be made in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial
Administration 2.420. Records found to be confidential under Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.420 must be sealed on request of a party.
(j) Court Filing of Documents and Discovery. Information obtained
during discovery must not be filed with the court until such time as it is filed for
good cause. The requirement of good cause is satisfied only where the filing of the
information is allowed or required by another applicable rule of procedure or by
court order.
57Commentary
1995 Adoption. Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.280 is to govern the
general discovery provisions in family law matters with the exceptions set forth
above. Subdivision (a) of this rule alters rule 1.280(e) by placing a duty on parties
in family law matters to supplement responses. Under rule 1.280(e), no
supplemental response is required. Subdivisions (b), (c), and (d) of this rule are in
addition to the general requirements of rule 1.280 and have no counterparts in the
Rules of Civil Procedure. Subdivisions (c) and (d) have been implemented in
recognition of the fact that family law cases often involve sensitive information
that should be deemed confidential under Florida Rule of Judicial Administration
2.051. For instance, financial records filed may contain information regarding a
family business, which, if public, could provide competitors with an advantage and
adversely affect the family business.
RULE 12.281. INADVERTENT DISCLOSURE OF PRIVILEGED
MATERIALS
(a) Assertion of Privilege as to Inadvertently Disclosed Materials.
Any party, person, or entity, after inadvertent disclosure of any materials under
these rules, may thereafter assert any privilege recognized by law as to those
materials. This right exists without regard to whether the disclosure was made
under formal demand or informal request. To assert the privilege, the party, person,
or entity must, within 10 days of actually discovering the inadvertent disclosure,
serve written notice of the assertion of privilege on the party to whom the materials
were disclosed. The notice must specify with particularity the materials as to which
the privilege is asserted, the nature of the privilege asserted, and the date on which
the inadvertent disclosure was actually discovered.
(b) Duty of the Party Receiving Notice of an Assertion of Privilege. A
party receiving notice of an assertion of privilege under subdivision (a) must
promptly return, sequester, or destroy the materials specified in the notice, as well
as any copies of the material. The party receiving the notice must also promptly
notify any other party, person, or entity to whom it has disclosed the materials of
the fact that the notice has been served and of the effect of this rule. That party
must also take reasonable steps to retrieve the materials disclosed. Nothing herein
affects any obligation under Rules Regulating the Florida Bar 4-4.4(b).
(c) Right to Challenge Assertion of Privilege. Any party receiving a
notice made under subdivision (a) has the right to challenge the assertion of
58privilege. The grounds for the challenge may include, but are not limited to, the
following:
(1) (2) The materials in question are not privileged.
The disclosing party, person, or entity lacks standing to assert
the privilege.
(3) notice under this rule.
The disclosing party, person, or entity has failed to serve timely
(4) The circumstances surrounding the production or disclosure of
the materials warrant a finding that the disclosing party, person, or entity has
waived its assertion that the material is protected by a privilege.
Any party seeking to challenge the assertion of privilege must do so by
serving notice of its challenge on the party, person, or entity asserting the privilege.
Notice of the challenge must be served within 20 days of service of the original
notice given by the disclosing party, person, or entity. The notice of the recipient’s
challenge must specify the grounds for the challenge. Failure to serve timely notice
of challenge is a waiver of the right to challenge.
(d) Effect of Determination that Privilege Applies. When an order is
entered determining that materials are privileged or that the right to challenge the
privilege has been waived, the court must direct what is to be done with the
materials and any copies so as to preserve all rights of appellate review. The
recipient of the materials must also give prompt notice of the court’s determination
to any other party, person, or entity to whom it had disclosed the materials.
RULE 12.285. MANDATORY DISCLOSURE
(a) Application.
(1) Scope. This rule applies to all proceedings within the scope of

affidavit or other documents shall be required under this rule from a party seeking
attorneys’ fees, suit money, or costs, if the basis for the request is solely under

59as to financial affidavits and child support guidelines worksheets, any portion of
this rule may be modified by order of the court or agreement of the parties.

the parties or ordered by the court, copies of documents required under this rule
may be produced in lieu of originals. Originals, when available, must be produced

filed a written settlement agreement disposing of all financial issues, or if the court
lacks jurisdiction to determine any financial issues.

automatically stays mandatory disclosure for those matters within the scope of the
objection. For good cause shown, the court may extend the time for the filing of an
64objection or permit the filing of an otherwise untimely objection. The court must
impose sanctions for the filing of meritless or frivolous objections.

support, the parties must file with the court at or before a hearing to establish or
modify child support a Child Support Guidelines Worksheet in substantial
conformity with Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(e). This
requirement cannot be waived by the parties.
(l ) Place of Production.
(1) Unless otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the court,
all production required by this rule takes place in the county where the action is
pending and in the office of the attorney for the party receiving production. Unless
otherwise agreed by the parties or ordered by the court, if a party does not have an
attorney or if the attorney does not have an office in the county where the action is
pending, production takes place in the county where the action is pending at a
place designated in writing by the party receiving production, served at least 5 days
before the due date for production.
(2) If venue is contested, on motion by a party the court must
designate the place where production will occur pending determination of the
venue issue.
(m) Failure of Defaulted Party to Comply. Nothing in this rule shall be
deemed to preclude the entry of a final judgment when a party in default has failed
to comply with this rule.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule creates a procedure for automatic financial
disclosure in family law cases. By requiring production at an early stage in the
65proceedings, it is hoped that the expense of litigation will be minimized. See
Dralus v. Dralus, 627 So.2d 505 (Fla. 2d DCA 1993); Wrona v. Wrona, 592 So.2d
694 (Fla. 2d DCA 1991); and Katz v. Katz, 505 So.2d 25 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987). A
limited number of requirements have been placed upon parties making and
spending less than $50,000 annually unless otherwise ordered by the court. In
cases where the income or expenses of a party are equal to or exceed $50,000
annually, the requirements are much greater. Except for the provisions as to
financial affidavits, other than as set forth in subdivision (k), any portion of this
rule may be modified by agreement of the parties or by order of the court. For
instance, upon the request of any party or on the court’s own motion, the court may
order that the parties to the proceeding comply with some or all of the automatic
mandatory disclosure provisions of this rule even though the parties do not meet
the income requirements set forth in subdivision (d). Additionally, the court may,
on the motion of a party or on its own motion, limit the disclosure requirements in
this rule should it find good cause for doing so.
Committee Notes
1997 Amendment. Except for the form of financial affidavit used,
mandatory disclosure is made the same for all parties subject to the rule, regardless
of income. The amount of information required to be disclosed is increased for
parties in the under-$50,000 category and decreased for parties in the $50,000-or-
over category. The standard family law interrogatories are no longer mandatory,
and their answers are designed to be supplemental and not duplicative of
information contained in the financial affidavits.
1998 Amendment. If one party has not provided necessary financial
information for the other party to complete a child support guidelines worksheet, a
good faith estimate should be made.
2005 Amendment. The requirement that a party certify compliance with
mandatory disclosure is intended to facilitate full disclosure and prevent a party
from alleging that he or she did not know he or she had to provide documents
required by this rule. This certification does not relieve the party of the duty to
supplement disclosure.
2012 Amendment. Subdivision (b)(1)(B) is amended to provide for e-mail
service in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
66RULE 12.287. FINANCIAL AFFIDAVITS IN ENFORCEMENT AND
CONTEMPT PROCEEDINGS
Any party in an enforcement or contempt proceeding may serve upon any
other party a written request to serve a financial affidavit if the other party’s
financial circumstances are relevant in the proceeding. The party to whom the
request is made shall serve the requested financial affidavit and file a notice of
compliance within 10 days after the service of the written request. The court may
allow a shorter or longer time. The financial affidavit shall be in substantial
conformity with Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) (Short
Form), all sections of which shall be completed.
RULE 12.290. DEPOSITIONS BEFORE ACTION OR PENDING
APPEAL
(a) Before Action.
(1) Petition. A person who desires to perpetuate that person’s own
testimony or that of another person regarding any matter that may be cognizable in
any court of this state may file a verified petition in the circuit court in the county
of the residence of any expected adverse party. The petition must:
(A) be titled in the name of the petitioner; and
(B) show:
(i) that the petitioner expects to be a party to an action
cognizable in a court of Florida, but is presently unable to bring it or cause it to be
brought,
(ii) the subject matter of the expected action and the
petitioner’s interest in it,
(iii) the facts which the petitioner desires to establish by
the proposed testimony and the petitioner’s reasons for desiring to perpetuate it,
(iv) the names or a description of the persons the
petitioner expects will be adverse parties and their addresses so far as known, and
(v) the names and addresses of the persons to be
examined and the substance of the testimony that the petitioner expects to elicit
67from each; and must ask for an order authorizing the petitioner to take the
deposition of the persons to be examined named in the petition for the purpose of
perpetuating their testimony.
(2) Notice and Service. The petitioner must serve a notice on each
person named in the petition as an expected adverse party, together with a copy of
the petition, stating that the petitioner will apply to the court at a time and place
named therein for an order described in the petition. At least 20 days before the
date of hearing the notice must be served either within or without the county in the
manner provided by law for service of summons, but if such service cannot with
due diligence be made on any expected adverse party named in the petition, the
court may make an order for service by publication or otherwise, and must appoint
an attorney for persons not served in the manner provided by law for service of
summons who will represent them, and if they are not otherwise represented, will
cross-examine the deponent.
(3) Order and Examination. If the court is satisfied that the
perpetuation of the testimony may prevent a failure or delay of justice, it must
make an order designating or describing the persons whose depositions may be
taken and specifying the subject matter of the examination and whether the
deposition shall be taken upon oral examination or written interrogatories. The
deposition may then be taken in accordance with these rules and the court may
make orders in accordance with the requirements of these rules. For the purpose of
applying these rules to depositions for perpetuating testimony, each reference to
the court in which the action is pending shall be deemed to refer to the court in
which the petition for deposition was filed.
(4) Use of Deposition. A deposition taken under this rule may be
used in any action involving the same subject matter subsequently brought in any
court in accordance with rule 12.330.
(b) Pending Appeal. If an appeal has been taken from a judgment of any
court or before the taking of an appeal if the time therefor has not expired, the
court in which the judgment was rendered may allow the taking of the depositions
of witnesses to perpetuate their testimony for use in the event of further
proceedings in the court. In such case the party who desires to perpetuate the
testimony may make a motion for leave to take the deposition on the same notice
and service as if the action was pending in the court. The motion must show (1) the
names and addresses of persons to be examined and the substance of the testimony
which the movant expects to elicit from each, and (2) the reason for perpetuating
68their testimony. If the court finds that the perpetuation of the testimony is proper to
avoid a failure or delay in justice, it may make an order allowing the deposition to
be taken and may make orders of the character provided for by these rules, and
thereupon the deposition may be taken and used in the same manner and under the
same conditions as are prescribed in these rules for depositions taken in actions
pending in the court.
(c) Perpetuation by Action. This rule does not limit the power of a court
to entertain an action to perpetuate testimony.
RULE 12.300. PERSONS BEFORE WHOM DEPOSITIONS MAY BE
TAKEN
(a) Persons Authorized. Depositions may be taken before any notary
public or judicial officer or before any officer authorized by the statutes of Florida
to take acknowledgments or proof of executions of deeds or by any person
appointed by the court in which the action is pending.
(b) In Foreign Countries. In a foreign country, depositions may be taken
(1) on notice before a person authorized to administer oaths in the place in which
the examination is held, either by the law thereof or by the law of Florida or of the
United States, (2) before a person commissioned by the court, and a person so
commissioned shall have the power by virtue of the commission to administer any
necessary oath and take testimony, or (3) pursuant to a letter of request. A
commission or a letter of request must be issued on application and notice and on
terms that are just and appropriate. It is not requisite to the issuance of a
commission or a letter of request that the taking of the deposition in any other
manner is impracticable or inconvenient, and both a commission and a letter of
request may be issued in proper cases. A notice or commission may designate the
person before whom the deposition is to be taken either by name or descriptive
title. A letter of request may be addressed “To the Appropriate Authority in
.....(name of country)......” Evidence obtained in response to a letter of request need
not be excluded merely for the reason that it is not a verbatim transcript or that the
testimony was not taken under oath or any similar departure from the requirements
for depositions taken within Florida under these rules.
(c) Selection by Stipulation. If the parties so stipulate in writing,
depositions may be taken before any person at any time or place upon any notice
and in any manner and when so taken may be used like other depositions.
69(d) Persons Disqualified. Unless so stipulated by the parties, no
deposition may be taken before a person who is a relative, employee, attorney, or
counsel of any of the parties, is a relative or employee of any of the parties’
attorneys or counsel, or is financially interested in the action.
RULE 12.310. DEPOSITIONS UPON ORAL EXAMINATION
(a) When Depositions May Be Taken. After commencement of the
action any party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by
deposition upon oral examination. Leave of court, granted with or without notice,
must be obtained only if the petitioner seeks to take a deposition within 30 days
after service of the process and initial pleading on any respondent, except that
leave is not required (1) if a respondent has served a notice of taking deposition or
otherwise sought discovery, or (2) if special notice is given as provided in
subdivision (b)(2). The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by subpoena as
provided in rule 12.410. The deposition of a person confined in prison may be
taken only by leave of court on such terms as the court prescribes.
(b) Notice; Method of Taking; Production at Deposition.
(1) A party desiring to take the deposition of any person upon oral
examination must give reasonable notice in writing to every other party to the
action. The notice must state the time and place for taking the deposition and the
name and address of each person to be examined, if known, and, if the name is not
known, a general description sufficient to identify the person or the particular class
or group to which the person belongs. If a subpoena duces tecum is to be served on
the person to be examined, the designation of the materials to be produced under
the subpoena must be attached to or included in the notice.
(2) Leave of court is not required for the taking of a deposition by
petitioner if the notice states that the person to be examined is about to go out of
the state and will be unavailable for examination unless a deposition is taken
before expiration of the 30-day period under subdivision (a). If a party shows that
when served with notice under this subdivision that party was unable through the
exercise of diligence to obtain counsel to represent the party at the taking of the
deposition, the deposition may not be used against that party.
(3) For cause shown the court may enlarge or shorten the time for
taking the deposition.
70(4) Any deposition may be recorded by videotape without leave of
the court or stipulation of the parties, provided the deposition is taken in
accordance with this subdivision.
(A) Notice. A party intending to videotape a deposition must
state in the notice that the deposition is to be videotaped and must give the name
and address of the operator. Any subpoena served on the person to be examined
must state the method or methods for recording the testimony.
(B) Court Reporter. Videotaped depositions must also be
stenographically recorded by a certified court reporter, unless all parties agree
otherwise.
(C) Procedure. At the beginning of the deposition, the officer
before whom it is taken must, on camera: (i) identify the style of the action, (ii)
state the date, and (iii) swear in the witness.
(D) Custody of Tape and Copies. The attorney for the party
requesting the videotaping of the deposition must take custody of and be
responsible for the safeguarding of the videotape, must permit the viewing of it by
the opposing party, and, if requested, must provide a copy of the videotape at the
expense of the party requesting the copy.
(E) Cost of Videotaped Depositions. The party requesting the
videotaping bears the initial cost of videotaping.
(5) The notice to a party deponent may be accompanied by a
request made in compliance with rule 12.350 for the production of documents and
tangible things at the taking of the deposition. The procedure of rule 12.350 applies
to the request. Rule 12.351 provides the exclusive procedure for obtaining
documents or things by subpoena from nonparties without deposing the custodian
or other person in possession of the documents.
(6) In the notice a party may name as the deponent a public or
private corporation, a partnership or association, or a governmental agency, and
designate with reasonable particularity the matters on which examination is
requested. The organization so named must designate one or more officers,
directors, or managing agents, or other persons who consent to do so, to testify on
its behalf and may state the matters on which each person designated will testify.
The persons so designated must testify about matters known or reasonably
71available to the organization. This subdivision does not preclude taking a
deposition by any other procedure authorized in these rules.
(7) On motion the court may order that the testimony at a
deposition be taken by telephone. The order may prescribe the manner in which the
deposition will be taken. A party may also arrange for a stenographic transcription
at that party’s own initial expense.
(8) Any minor subpoenaed for testimony has the right to be
accompanied by a parent, guardian, guardian ad litem, or attorney ad litem at all
times during the taking of testimony notwithstanding the invocation of the rule of
sequestration of section 90.616, Florida Statutes, except on a showing that the
presence of a parent or guardian is likely to have a material, negative impact on the
credibility or accuracy of the minor’s testimony, or that the interests of the parent
or guardian are in actual or potential conflict with the interests of the minor. The
provisions of this subdivision do not alter the requirements of rule 12.407 that a
court order must be obtained before a minor child may be deposed or brought to a
deposition.
(c) Examination and Cross-Examination; Record of Examination;
Oath; Objections. Examination and cross-examination of witnesses may proceed
as permitted at the trial. The officer before whom the deposition is to be taken must
put the witness on oath and must personally, or by someone acting under the
officer’s direction and in the officer’s presence, record the testimony of the
witness, except that when a deposition is being taken by telephone, the witness
must be sworn by a person present with the witness who is qualified to administer
an oath in that location. The testimony must be taken stenographically or recorded
by any other means ordered in accordance with subdivision (b)(4). If requested by
one of the parties, the testimony must be transcribed at the initial cost of the
requesting party and prompt notice of the request must be given to all other parties.
All objections made at the time of the examination to the qualifications of the
officer taking the deposition, the manner of taking it, the evidence presented, or the
conduct of any party, and any other objection to the proceedings must be noted by
the officer during the deposition. Any objection during a deposition must be stated
concisely and in a nonargumentative and nonsuggestive manner. A party may
instruct a deponent not to answer only when necessary to preserve a privilege, to
enforce a limitation on evidence directed by the court, or to present a motion under
subdivision (d). Otherwise, evidence objected to must be taken subject to the
objections. Instead of participating in the oral examination, parties may serve
written questions in a sealed envelope on the party taking the deposition and that
72party must transmit them to the officer, who must propound them to the witness
and record the answers verbatim.
(d) Motion to Terminate or Limit Examination. At any time during the
taking of the deposition, on motion of a party or of the deponent and on a showing
that the examination is being conducted in bad faith or in such manner as
unreasonably to annoy, embarrass, or oppress the deponent or party, or that
objection and instruction to a deponent not to answer are being made in violation
of subdivision (c), the court in which the action is pending or the circuit court
where the deposition is being taken may order the officer conducting the
examination to cease immediately from taking the deposition or may limit the
scope and manner of the taking of the deposition under rule 12.280(d). If the order
terminates the examination, it shall be resumed thereafter only on the order of the
court in which the action is pending. On demand of any party or the deponent, the
taking of the deposition must be suspended for the time necessary to make a
motion for an order. The provisions of rule 12.380(a)(4) apply to the award of
expenses incurred in relation to the motion.
(e) Witness Review. If the testimony is transcribed, the transcript must
be furnished to the witness for examination and must be read to or by the witness
unless the examination and reading are waived by the witness and by the parties.
Any changes in form or substance that the witness wants to make must be listed in
writing by the officer with a statement of the reasons given by the witness for
making the changes. The changes must be attached to the transcript. It must then
be signed by the witness unless the parties waived the signing or the witness is ill,
cannot be found, or refuses to sign. If the transcript is not signed by the witness
within a reasonable time after it is furnished to the witness, the officer signs the
transcript and states on the transcript the waiver, illness, absence of the witness, or
refusal to sign with any reasons given. The deposition may then be used as fully as
though signed unless the court holds that the reasons given for the refusal to sign
require rejection of the deposition wholly or partly, on motion under rule
12.330(d)(4).
(f) Filing; Exhibits.
(1) If the deposition is transcribed, the officer must certify on each
copy of the deposition that the witness was duly sworn by the officer and that the
deposition is a true record of the testimony given by the witness. Documents and
things produced for inspection during the examination of the witness must be
marked for identification and annexed to and returned with the deposition on the
73request of a party, and may be inspected and copied by any party, except that the
person producing the materials may substitute copies to be marked for
identification if that person affords to all parties fair opportunity to verify the
copies by comparison with the originals. If the person producing the materials
requests their return, the officer must mark them, give each party an opportunity to
inspect and copy them, and return them to the person producing them and the
materials may then be used in the same manner as if annexed to and returned with
the deposition.
(2) On payment of reasonable charges therefor the officer must
furnish a copy of the deposition to any party or to the deponent.
(3) A copy of a deposition may be filed only under the following
circumstances:
(A) It may be filed in compliance with Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.425 and rule 12.280(j) by a party or the witness when the
contents of the deposition must be considered by the court on any matter pending
before the court. Prompt notice of the filing of the deposition must be given to all
parties unless notice is waived. A party filing the deposition must furnish a copy of
the deposition or the part being filed to other parties unless the party already has a
copy.
(B) If the court determines that a deposition previously taken
is necessary for the decision of a matter pending before the court, the court may
order that a copy be filed by any party at the initial cost of the party, and the filing
party must comply with rules 2.425 and 12.280(j).
(g) Obtaining Copies. A party or witness who does not have a copy of
the deposition may obtain it from the officer taking the deposition unless the court
orders otherwise. If the deposition is obtained from a person other than the officer,
the reasonable cost of reproducing the copies must be paid to the person by the
requesting party or witness.
(h) Failure to Attend or to Serve Subpoena; Expenses.
(1) If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition fails
to attend and proceed with the deposition and another party attends in person or by
attorney pursuant to the notice, the court may order the party giving the notice to
pay to the other party the reasonable expenses incurred by the other party and the
other party’s attorney in attending, including reasonable attorneys’ fees.
74(2) If the party giving the notice of the taking of a deposition of a
witness fails to serve a subpoena on the witness and the witness because of the
failure does not attend and if another party attends in person or by attorney because
that other party expects the deposition of that witness to be taken, the court may
order the party giving the notice to pay to the other party the reasonable expenses
incurred by that other party and that other party’s attorney in attending, including
reasonable attorneys’ fees.
Committee Note
2008 Amendment. The provisions of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.310(b)(8) do not alter
the requirements of Rule 12.407 that a court order must be obtained before
deposing a minor child.
RULE 12.320. DEPOSITIONS UPON WRITTEN QUESTIONS
(a) Serving Questions; Notice. After commencement of the action any
party may take the testimony of any person, including a party, by deposition upon
written questions. The attendance of witnesses may be compelled by the use of
subpoena as provided in rule 12.410. The deposition of a person confined in prison
may be taken only by leave of court on such terms as the court prescribes. A party
desiring to take a deposition upon written questions must serve them with a notice
stating
(1) the name and address of the person who is to answer them, if
known, and, if the name is not known, a general description sufficient to identify
the person or the particular class or group to which that person belongs, and
(2) whom the deposition is to be taken.
the name or descriptive title and address of the officer before
Within 30 days after the notice and written questions are served, a party may
serve cross questions on all other parties. Within 10 days after being served with
cross questions, a party may serve redirect questions on all other parties. Within 10
days after being served with redirect questions, a party may serve recross questions
on all other parties. The court may for cause shown enlarge or shorten the time.
(b) Officer to Take Responses and Prepare Record. A copy of the
notice and copies of all questions served must be delivered by the party taking the
depositions to the officer designated in the notice, who must proceed promptly to
take the testimony of the witness in the manner provided by rules 12.310(c), (e),
75and (f) in response to the questions and to prepare the deposition, attaching the
copy of the notice and the questions received by the officer. The questions must
not be filed separately from the deposition unless a party seeks to have the court
consider the questions before the questions are submitted to the witness.
RULE 12.330. USE OF DEPOSITIONS IN COURT PROCEEDINGS
(a) Use of Depositions. At the trial or on the hearing of a motion or an
interlocutory proceeding, any part or all of a deposition may be used against any
party who was present or represented at the taking of the deposition or who had
reasonable notice of it so far as admissible under the rules of evidence applied as
though the witness were then present and testifying in accordance with any of the
following provisions:
(1) Any deposition may be used by any party for the purpose of
contradicting or impeaching the testimony of the deponent as a witness or for any
purpose permitted by the Florida Evidence Code.
(2) The deposition of a party may be used by an adverse party for
any purpose.
(3) The deposition of a witness, whether or not a party, may be
used by any party for any purpose if the court finds:
(A) that the witness is dead;
(B) that the witness is at a greater distance than 100 miles
from the place of trial or hearing, or is out of the state, unless it appears that the
absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the deposition;
(C) age, illness, infirmity, or imprisonment;
that the witness is unable to attend or testify because of
(D) that the party offering the deposition has been unable to
procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena;
(E) on application and notice, that such exceptional
circumstances exist as to make it desirable, in the interest of justice and with due
regard to the importance of presenting the testimony of witnesses orally in open
court, to allow the deposition to be used; or
76(F) the witness is an expert or skilled witness.
(4) If only part of a deposition is offered in evidence by a party, an
adverse party may require the party to introduce any other part that in fairness
ought to be considered with the part introduced, and any party may introduce any
other parts.
(b) Objections to Admissibility. Subject to the provisions of subdivision
(d)(3) of this rule and of rule 12.300(b), objection may be made at the trial or
hearing to receiving in evidence any deposition or part of it for any reason that
would require the exclusion of the evidence if the witness were then present and
testifying.
(c) Effect of Taking or Using Depositions. A party does not make a
person the party’s own witness for any purpose by taking the person’s deposition.
The introduction in evidence of the deposition or any part of it for any purpose
other than that of contradicting or impeaching the deponent makes the deponent
the witness of the party introducing the deposition, but this does not apply to the
use by an adverse party of a deposition under subdivision (a)(2). At the trial or
hearing any party may rebut any relevant evidence contained in a deposition
whether introduced by that party or by any other party.
(d) Effect of Errors and Irregularities.
(1) As to Notice. All errors and irregularities in the notice for
taking a deposition are waived unless written objection is promptly served on the
party giving the notice.
(2) As to Disqualification of Officer. Objection to taking a
deposition because of disqualification of the officer before whom it is to be taken
is waived unless made before the taking of the deposition begins or as soon
thereafter as the disqualification becomes known or could be discovered with
reasonable diligence.
(3) As to Taking of Deposition.
(A) Objections to the competency of a witness or to the
competency, relevancy, or materiality of testimony are not waived by failure to
make them before or during the taking of the deposition unless the ground of the
objection is one that might have been obviated or removed if presented at that time.
77(B) Errors and irregularities occurring at the oral examination
in the manner of taking the deposition, in the form of the questions or answers, in
the oath or affirmation, or in the conduct of parties and errors of any kind that
might be obviated, removed, or cured if promptly presented are waived unless
timely objection to them is made at the taking of the deposition.
(C) Objections to the form of written questions submitted
under rule 12.320 are waived unless served in writing on the party propounding
them within the time allowed for serving the succeeding cross or other questions
and within 10 days after service of the last questions authorized.
(4) As to Completion and Return. Errors and irregularities in the
manner in which the testimony is transcribed or the deposition is prepared, signed,
certified, or otherwise dealt with by the officer under rules 12.310 and 12.320 are
waived unless a motion to suppress the deposition or some part of it is made with
reasonable promptness after the defect is, or with due diligence might have been,
discovered.
RULE 12.340. INTERROGATORIES TO PARTIES
(a) Procedure for Use. Without leave of court, any party may serve on
any other party written interrogatories to be answered by the party to whom the
interrogatories are directed, or if that party is a public or private corporation or
partnership or association or governmental agency, by any officer or agent, who
must furnish the information available to that party. Interrogatories may be served
on the petitioner after commencement of the action and on any other party with or
after service of the process and initial pleading on that party. A party may serve
fewer than all of the approved interrogatories within a form.
(1) Initial Interrogatories. Initial interrogatories to parties in
original and enforcement actions must be those set forth in Florida Family Law
Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(b). Parties governed by the mandatory disclosure
requirements of rule 12.285 may serve the interrogatories set forth in Florida
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(b).
(2) Modification Interrogatories. Interrogatories to parties in
cases involving modification of a final judgment must be those set forth in Florida
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(c). Parties governed by the
mandatory disclosure requirements of rule 12.285 may serve the interrogatories set
forth in Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(c).
78(b) Additional Interrogatories. Ten interrogatories, including subparts,
may be sent to a party, in addition to the standard interrogatories contained in
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(b) or Florida Family Law
Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(c). A party must obtain permission of the court to
send more than 10 additional interrogatories.
(c) Service of and Objections to Interrogatories. Each interrogatory
must be answered separately and fully in writing under oath unless it is objected to,
in which event the grounds for objection must be stated and signed. The party to
whom the interrogatories are directed must serve the answers and any objections
within 30 days after the service of the interrogatories, except that a respondent may
serve answers or objections within 45 days after service of the process and initial
pleading on that respondent. The court may allow a shorter or longer time. The
party submitting the interrogatories may move for an order under rule 12.380(a) on
any objection to or other failure to answer an interrogatory.
(d) Serving of Responses. Parties must serve responses to interrogatories
on the requesting party. Responses must not be filed with the court unless they are
admitted into evidence by the court and are in compliance with Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.425. The responding party must file with the court
Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(d), Notice of Service of
Answers to Standard Family Law Interrogatories.
(e) Scope; Use at Trial. Interrogatories may relate to any matters that can
be inquired into under rule 12.280(b), and the answers may be used to the extent
permitted by the rules of evidence except as otherwise provided in this subdivision.
An interrogatory otherwise proper is not objectionable merely because an answer
to the interrogatory involves an opinion or contention that relates to fact or calls for
a conclusion or asks for information not within the personal knowledge of the
party. A party must respond to such an interrogatory by giving the information the
party has and the source on which the information is based. Such a qualified
answer may not be used as direct evidence for or impeachment against the party
giving the answer unless the court finds it otherwise admissible under the rules of
evidence.
(f) Option to Produce Records. When the answer to an interrogatory
may be derived or ascertained from the records (including electronically stored
information) of the party to whom the interrogatory is directed or from an
examination, audit, or inspection of the records or from a compilation, abstract, or
summary based on the records and the burden of deriving or ascertaining the
79answer is substantially the same for the party serving the interrogatory as for the
party to whom it is directed, an answer to the interrogatory specifying the records
from which the answer may be derived or ascertained and offering to give the party
serving the interrogatory a reasonable opportunity to examine, audit, or inspect the
records and to make copies, compilations, abstracts, or summaries, production of
the records in lieu of a written response is a sufficient answer. An answer must be
in sufficient detail to permit the interrogating party to locate and to identify, as
readily as can the party interrogated, the records from which the answer may be
derived or ascertained, or must identify a person or persons representing the
interrogated party who will be available to assist the interrogating party in locating
and identifying the records at the time they are produced. If the records to be
produced consist of electronically stored information, the records must be
produced in a form or forms in which they are ordinarily maintained or in a
reasonably usable form or forms.
(g) any other party.
Effect on Other Parties. Answers made by a party are not binding on
(h) Service. Interrogatories must be arranged so that a blank space is
provided after each separately numbered interrogatory. The space must be
reasonably sufficient to enable the answering party to insert the answer within the
space. If sufficient space is not provided, the answering party may attach additional
pages with answers and refer to them in the space provided in the interrogatories.
The interrogatories must be served on the party to whom the interrogatories are
directed and copies must be served on all other parties. A certificate of service of
the interrogatories must be filed, giving the date of service and the name of the
party to whom they were directed.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. For parties governed under the disclosure requirements of
rule 12.285(d) (income or expenses of $50,000 or more), the answers to the
interrogatories contained in Form 12.930(b) must be automatically served on the
other party. For parties governed under the disclosure requirements of rule
12.285(c) (income and expenses under $50,000), the service of the interrogatories
contained in Form 12.930(b) is optional as provided in Florida Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.340. Additionally, under this rule, 10 additional interrogatories,
including subparts, may be submitted beyond those contained in Florida Family
Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.930(b). Leave of court is required to exceed 10
additional interrogatories. The provisions of Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.340
are to govern the procedures and scope of the additional interrogatories.
80Committee Note
1997 Amendment. The rule was amended to conform to the changes made
to rule 12.285, Mandatory Disclosure.
RULE 12.350. PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND THINGS AND
ENTRY ON LAND FOR INSPECTION AND OTHER
PURPOSES
(a) Request; Scope. Any party may request any other party
(1) to produce and permit the party making the request, or someone
acting in the requesting party’s behalf, to inspect and copy any designated
documents, including electronically stored information, writings, drawings, graphs,
charts, photographs, audio, visual, or digital recordings, and other data
compilations from which information can be obtained, translated, if necessary, by
the party to whom the request is directed through detection devices into reasonably
usable form, that constitute or contain matters within the scope of rule 12.280(c)
and that are in the possession, custody, or control of the party to whom the request
is directed;
(2) to inspect and copy, test, or sample any tangible things that
constitute or contain matters within the scope of rule 12.280(c) and that are in the
possession, custody, or control of the party to whom the request is directed; or
(3) to permit entry on designated land or other property in the
possession or control of the party on whom the request is served for the purpose of
inspection and measuring, surveying, photographing, testing, or sampling the
property or any designated object or operation on it within the scope of rule
12.280(c).
(b) Procedure. Without leave of court the request may be served on the
petitioner after commencement of the action and on any other party with or after
service of the process and initial pleading on that party. The request must set forth
the items to be inspected, either by individual item or category, and describe each
item and category with reasonable particularity. The request must specify a
reasonable time, place, and manner of making the inspection or performing the
related acts. The party to whom the request is directed must serve a written
response within 30 days after service of the request, except that a defendant may
serve a response within 45 days after service of the process and initial pleading on
that defendant. The court may allow a shorter or longer time. For each item or
81category, the response must state that inspection and related activities will be
permitted as requested unless the request is objected to, in which event the reasons
for the objection must be stated. If an objection is made to part of an item or
category, the part must be specified. When producing documents, the producing
party must either produce them as they are kept in the usual course of business or
must identify them to correspond with the categories in the request. A request for
electronically stored information may specify the form or forms in which
electronically stored information is to be produced. If the responding party objects
to a requested form, or if no form is specified in the request, the responding party
must state the form or forms it intends to use. If a request for electronically stored
information does not specify the form of production, the producing party must
produce the information in a form or forms in which it is ordinarily maintained or
in a reasonably usable form or forms. The party submitting the request may move
for an order under rule 12.380 concerning any objection, failure to respond to the
request, or any part of it, or failure to permit the inspection as requested.
(c) Persons Not Parties. This rule does not preclude an independent
action against a person not a party for production of documents and things and
permission to enter on land.
(d) Filing of Documents. Unless required by the court, a party shall not
file any of the documents or things produced with the response. Documents or
things may be filed in compliance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration
2.425 and rule 12.280(j) when they should be considered by the court in
determining a matter pending before the court.
RULE 12.351. PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND THINGS
WITHOUT DEPOSITION
(a) Request; Scope. A party may seek inspection and copying of any
documents or things within the scope of rule 12.350(a) from a person who is not a
party by issuance of a subpoena directing the production of the documents or
things when the requesting party does not seek to depose the custodian or other
person in possession of the documents or things. This rule provides the exclusive
procedure for obtaining documents or things by subpoena from nonparties without
deposing the custodian or other person in possession of the documents or things
under rule 12.310.
(b) Procedure. A party desiring production under this rule must serve
notice as provided in Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516 on every other
82party of the intent to serve a subpoena under this rule at least 10 days before the
subpoena is issued if service is by delivery and 15 days before the subpoena is
issued if the service is by mail or e-mail. The proposed subpoena must be attached
to the notice and must state the time, place, and method for production of the
documents or things, and the name and address of the person who is to produce the
documents or things, if known, and if not known, a general description sufficient to
identify the person or the particular class or group to which the person belongs;
must include a designation of the items to be produced; and must state that the
person who will be asked to produce the documents or things has the right to object
to the production under this rule and that the person will not be required to
surrender the documents or things. A copy of the notice and proposed subpoena
shall not be furnished to the person on whom the subpoena is to be served. If any
party serves an objection to production under this rule within 10 days of service of
the notice, the documents or things must not be produced pending resolution of the
objection in accordance with subdivision (d).
(c) Subpoena. If no objection is made by a party under subdivision (b),
an attorney of record in the action may issue a subpoena or the party desiring
production must deliver to the clerk for issuance a subpoena together with a
certificate of counsel or pro se party that no timely objection has been received
from any party, and the clerk must issue the subpoena and deliver it to the party
desiring production. Service within the state of Florida of a nonparty subpoena is
deemed sufficient if it complies with rule 12.410(d) or if (1) service is
accomplished by mail or hand delivery by a commercial delivery service, and (2)
written confirmation of delivery, with the date of service and the name and
signature of the person accepting the subpoena, is obtained and filed by the party
seeking production. The subpoena must be identical to the copy attached to the
notice and must specify that no testimony may be taken and must require only
production of the documents or things specified in it. The subpoena may give the
recipient an option to deliver or mail legible copies of the documents or things to
the party serving the subpoena. The person on whom the subpoena is served may
condition the preparation of copies on the payment in advance of the reasonable
costs of preparing the copies. The subpoena may require production only in the
county of the residence of the custodian or other person in possession of the
documents or things or in the county where the documents or things are located or
where the custodian or person in possession usually conducts business. If the
person on whom the subpoena is served objects at any time before the production
of the documents or things, the documents or things will not be produced under
this rule, and relief may be obtained under rule 12.310.
83(d) Ruling on Objection. If an objection is made by a party under
subdivision (b), the party desiring production may file a motion with the court
seeking a ruling on the objection or may proceed under rule 12.310.
(e) Copies Furnished. If the subpoena is complied with by delivery or
mailing of copies as provided in subdivision (c), the party receiving the copies may
furnish a legible copy of each item furnished to any other party who requests it
upon the payment of the reasonable cost of preparing the copies.
(f) Independent Action. This rule does not affect the right of any party
to bring an independent action for production of documents and things or
permission to enter on land.
Committee Note
2012 Amendment. This rule is amended to provide for service in
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
RULE 12.360. EXAMINATION OF PERSONS
(a) Request; Scope.
(1) A party may request any other party to submit to, or to produce
a person in that other party’s custody or legal control for, examination by a
qualified expert when the condition that is the subject of the requested examination
is in controversy. Examinations may include, but are not limited to, examinations
involving physical or mental condition, employability or vocational testing, genetic
testing, or any other type of examination related to a matter in controversy.
(A) When the physical condition of a party or other person
under subdivision (a)(1) is in controversy, the request may be served on the party
or other persons without leave of court after commencement of the action, and on
any other person or party with or after service of the process and initial pleading.
The request must specify a reasonable time, place, manner, conditions, and scope
of the examination and the person or persons by whom the examination is to be
made. The party to whom the request is directed must serve a response within 30
days after service of the request, except that a respondent need not serve a response
until 45 days after service of the process and initial pleading on that respondent.
The court may allow a shorter or longer time. The response must state that the
examination will be permitted as requested unless the request is objected to, in
which event the reasons for the objection must be stated. If the examination is to be
84recorded or observed by others, the request or response must also include the
number of people attending, their role, and the method or methods of recording.
(B) In cases in which the condition in controversy is not
physical, a party may move for an examination by a qualified expert as in
subdivision (a)(1). The order for examination may be made only after notice to the
person to be examined and to all parties, and must specify the time, place, manner,
conditions, and scope of the examination and the person or persons by whom it is
to be made.
(C) The examination of a minor child is governed by rule
12.363.
(D) Social investigations are governed by rule 12.364.
(2) An examination under this rule is authorized only when the
party submitting the request has good cause for the examination. At any hearing
the party submitting the request has the burden of showing good cause.
(3) On request of either the party requesting the examination or the
party or person to be examined, the court may establish protective rules governing
such examination.
(b) Report of Examiner.
(1) If requested by the party to whom a request for examination or
against whom an order is made under subdivision (a)(1)(A) or (a)(1)(B) or by the
person examined, the party requesting the examination must deliver to the other
party a copy of a detailed written report of the examiner setting out the examiner’s
findings, including results of all tests made, diagnosis, and conclusions, with
similar reports of all earlier examinations of the same condition. After delivery of
the detailed written report, the party requesting the examination is entitled, on
request, to receive from the party to whom the request for examination or against
whom the order is made a similar report of any examination of the same condition
previously or thereafter made, unless in the case of a report of examination of a
person not a party the party shows the inability to obtain it. On motion, the court
may order delivery of a report on such terms as are just; and if an examiner fails or
refuses to make a report, the court may exclude the examiner’s testimony if offered
at the trial.
85(2) By requesting and obtaining a report of the examination so
ordered or requested or by taking the deposition of the examiner, the party
examined waives any privilege that party may have in that action or any other
involving the same controversy regarding the testimony of every other person who
has examined or may thereafter examine that party concerning the same condition.
(3) This subdivision applies to examinations made by agreement of
the parties unless the agreement provides otherwise. This subdivision does not
preclude discovery of a report of an examiner or taking the deposition of the
examiner in accordance with any other rule.
(c) Examiner as Witness. The examiner may be called as a witness by
any party to the action, but is not to be identified as appointed by the court.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule expands Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.360 to
specify common examinations in family law matters, but this rule is not intended
to be an exclusive list of allowable examinations. Rule 1.360 should be interpreted
to discourage subjecting children to multiple interviews, testing, and evaluations.
RULE 12.363. EVALUATION OF MINOR CHILD
(a) Appointment of Expert.
(1) The court, on motion of any party or the court’s own motion,
may appoint an expert for an examination, evaluation, testing, or interview of any
minor child. The parties may agree on the particular expert to be appointed, subject
to approval by the court. If the parties have agreed, they shall submit an order
including the name, address, telephone number, area of expertise, and professional
qualifications of the expert. If there has been a determination of the need for the
appointment of an expert and the parties cannot agree on the selection of the
expert, the court shall appoint an expert.
(2) After the examination, evaluation, or investigation, any party
may file a motion for an additional expert examination, evaluation, interview,
testing, or investigation by another expert. The court upon hearing may permit the
additional examination, evaluation, testing, or interview only on a showing of good
cause and only upon a finding that further examinations, testing, interviews, or
evaluations would be in the best interests of the minor child.
86(3) addressed by the expert.
Any order entered under this rule shall specify the issues to be
(4) Any order entered under this rule may require that all
interviews of the child be recorded and the tapes be maintained as part of the
expert’s file.
(5) The order appointing the expert shall include an initial
allocation of responsibility for payment.
(6) A copy of the order of appointment shall be provided
immediately to the expert by the court unless otherwise directed by the court. The
order shall direct the parties to contact the expert appointed by the court to
establish an appointment schedule to facilitate timely completion of the evaluation.
(b) Providing of Reports.
(1) Unless otherwise ordered, the expert shall prepare and provide a
written report to each party and the guardian ad litem, if appointed, a reasonable
time before any evidentiary hearing on the matter at issue. The expert also shall
send written notice to the court that the report has been completed and that a copy
of the written report has been provided to each party and the guardian ad litem, if
appointed. In any event, the written report shall be prepared and provided no later
than 30 days before trial or 75 days from the order of appointment, unless the time
is extended by order of the court. The expert shall not send a copy of the report to
the court unless the parties and their attorneys have agreed in writing that the
report will be considered by the court and filed in the court files as provided in
subdivision (e).
(2) On motion of any party, the court may order the expert to
produce the expert’s complete file to another expert at the initial cost of the
requesting party, for review by such expert, who may testify.
(c) Testimony of Other Experts. Any other expert who has treated,
tested, interviewed, examined, or evaluated a child may testify only if the court
determines that good cause exists to permit the testimony. The fact that no notice
of such treatment, testing, interview, examination, or evaluation of a child was
given to both parents shall be considered by the court as a basis for preventing such
testimony.
87(d) Communications with Court by Expert. No expert may
communicate with the court without prior notice to the parties, who shall be
afforded the opportunity to be present and heard during any such communication
between the expert and the court. A request for communication with the court may
be informally conveyed by letter or telephone. Further communication with the
court, which may be conducted informally, shall be done only with notice to the
parties.
(e) Use of Evidence. An expert appointed by the court shall be subject to
the same examination as a privately retained expert and the court shall not entertain
any presumption in favor of the appointed expert’s findings. Any finding or report
by an expert appointed by the court may be entered into evidence on the court’s
own motion or the motion of any party in a manner consistent with the rules of
evidence, subject to cross-examination by the parties. Any report filed with the
court shall be in compliance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425.
The report shall not be filed in the court file unless or until it is properly admitted
into evidence and considered by the court. The court shall consider whether the
report should be sealed as provided by Florida Rule of Judicial Administration
2.420.
(f) Limitation of Scope. This rule shall not apply to parenting
coordinators or social investigators.
Committee Note
1997 Adoption. This rule should be interpreted to discourage subjecting
children to multiple interviews, testing, and evaluations, without good cause
shown. The court should consider the best interests of the child in permitting
evaluations, testing, or interviews of the child. The parties should cooperate in
choosing a mental health professional or individual to perform this function to
lessen the need for multiple evaluations.
This rule is not intended to prevent additional mental health professionals
who have not treated, interviewed, or evaluated the child from testifying
concerning review of the data produced pursuant to this rule.
This rule is not intended to prevent a mental health professional who has
engaged in long-term treatment of the child from testifying about the minor child.
88RULE 12.364. SOCIAL INVESTIGATIONS
(a) Applicable to Social Investigations. This rule shall apply to the
appointment of an investigator to conduct a social investigation and study under
section 61.20, Florida Statutes.
(b) Appointment of Social Investigator. When the issue of time-
sharing, parental responsibility, ultimate decision-making, or a parenting plan for a
minor child is in controversy, the court, on motion of any party or the court’s own
motion, may appoint an investigator under section 61.20, Florida Statutes. The
parties may agree on the particular investigator to be appointed, subject to approval
by the court. If the parties have agreed on the need for a social investigation or the
court has determined there is such need, and the parties cannot agree on the
selection, the court shall select and appoint an investigator. The social investigator
must be qualified as an expert under section 90.702, Florida Statutes, to testify
regarding the written study.
(c) Order for Social Investigation. The order for a social investigation
shall state whether this is an initial establishment of a parenting plan or a
modification of an existing parenting plan. The investigator shall be required to
consider the best interests of the child based upon all of factors affecting the
welfare and interest of the particular minor child and the circumstances of that
family, including, but not limited to the statutory factors set forth in section 61.13,
Florida Statutes.
(d) Order Appointing Social Investigator. An order appointing a social
investigator shall state that the investigator is being appointed under section 61.20,
Florida Statutes, and shall state:
(1) The name, address, and telephone number for each parent.
(2) being appointed.
The name, address, and telephone number of the investigator
(3) Any specific issues to be addressed.
(4) An initial allocation of responsibility for payment of the costs
for the social investigation. The court may consider taxing the costs at a final
hearing.
89(5) The order shall direct the parties to contact the investigator
appointed by the court to establish an appointment schedule to facilitate timely
completion of the investigation. A copy of the order of appointment shall be
provided immediately to the investigator by the court, unless otherwise directed by
the court.
(e) Written Study with Recommendations. The investigator shall
prepare a written study with recommendations regarding a parenting plan,
including a written statement of facts found in the social investigation on which the
recommendations are based. The written study with recommendations shall be
furnished to the court and a copy provided to all parties of record by the
investigator at least 30 days before any hearing at which the court is to consider the
written study and recommendations, unless otherwise ordered by the court.
(f) Additional Investigation. After the written study is furnished to the
court, any party may file a motion for an additional expert examination, evaluation,
interview, testing, or investigation. The court upon hearing may order the
additional examination, evaluation, testing, or interview of the minor child based
on the court finding that the investigation is insufficient and that further
examinations, testing, interviews, or evaluations of the minor child would be in the
best interests of the minor child.
(g) Production of File. On motion of any party, the court may order the
investigator to produce the investigator’s complete file to another qualified
investigator for review by such investigator, who may render an opinion and
testify.
RULE 12.365. EXPERT WITNESSES
(a) Application. The procedural requirements in this rule shall apply
whenever an expert is appointed by the court or retained by a party. This rule
applies to all experts including, but not limited to, medical, psychological, social,
financial, vocational, and economic experts.
(b) Communication with Court by Expert. No expert may
communicate with the court without prior notice to the parties and their attorneys,
who must be afforded the opportunity to be present and heard during the
communication between the expert and the court. A request for communication
with the court may be conveyed informally by letter or telephone. Further
communication with the court, which may be conducted informally, may be done
only with notice to all parties.
90(c) Use of Evidence. The court may not entertain any presumption in
favor of a court-appointed expert’s opinion. Any opinion by an expert may be
entered into evidence on the court’s own motion or the motion of any party in a
manner consistent with the rules of evidence, subject to cross-examination by the
parties.
(d) Evaluation of Minor Child. This rule does not apply to any
evaluation of a minor child under rule 12.363.
Committee Note
1998 Adoption. This rule establishes the procedure to be followed for the
use of experts. The District Court of Appeal, Fourth District, has encouraged the
use of court-appointed experts to review financial information and reduce the cost
of divorce litigation. Tomaino v. Tomaino, 629 So.2d 874 (Fla. 4th DCA 1993).
Additionally, section 90.615(1), Florida Statutes, allows the court to call witnesses
whom all parties may cross-examine. See also Fed. R. Evid. 706 (trial courts have
authority to appoint expert witnesses).
RULE 12.370. REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
(a) Request for Admission.
(1) Service of Request. A party may serve on any other party a
written request for the admission of the truth of any matters within the scope of
rule 12.280(c), set forth in the request that relate to statements or opinions of fact
or of the application of law to fact, including the genuineness of any documents
described in the request. The request and any response must comply with Florida
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425. Copies of documents must be served with
the request unless they have been or are otherwise furnished or made available for
inspection and copying. However, documents attached to the request for admission
may not be filed with the court and may only be attached to the copy served on the
party to whom the request for admission is directed. Without leave of court the
request may be served on the petitioner after commencement of the action and on
any other party with or after service of the process and initial pleading on that
party.
(2) Limit on Number of Requests. The request for admission may
not exceed 30 requests, including all subparts, unless the court permits a larger
number on motion and notice and for good cause, or the parties propounding and
91responding to the requests stipulate to a larger number. Each matter of which an
admission is requested must be separately set forth.
(3) Answer or Objection to Request. The matter is admitted
unless the party to whom the request is directed serves on the party requesting the
admission a written answer or objection addressed to the matter within 30 days
after service of the request or such shorter or longer time as the court may allow
but, unless the court shortens the time, a respondent will not be required to serve
answers or objections before the expiration of 45 days after service of the process
and initial pleading on the respondent. If objection is made, the reasons must be
stated. The answer must specifically deny the matter or set forth in detail the
reasons why the answering party cannot truthfully admit or deny the matter. A
denial must fairly meet the substance of the requested admission, and when good
faith requires that a party qualify an answer or deny only a part of the matter of
which an admission is requested, the party must specify so much of it as is true and
qualify or deny the remainder. An answering party may not give lack of
information or knowledge as a reason for failure to admit or deny unless that party
states that that party has made reasonable inquiry and that the information known
or readily obtainable by that party is insufficient to enable that party to admit or
deny. A party who considers that a matter of which an admission has been
requested presents a genuine issue for trial may not object to the request on that
ground alone; the party may deny the matter or set forth reasons why the party
cannot admit or deny it, subject to rule 12.380(c).
(4) Motion to Determine Sufficiency of Answers or Objections.
The party who has requested the admissions may move to determine the
sufficiency of the answers or objections. Unless the court determines that an
objection is justified, it must order that an answer be served. If the court
determines that an answer does not comply with the requirements of this rule, it
may order either that the matter is admitted or that an amended answer be served.
Instead of these orders the court may determine that final disposition of the request
be made at a pretrial conference or at a designated time before trial. The provisions
of rule 12.380(a)(4) apply to the award of expenses incurred in relation to the
motion.
(b) Effect of Admission. Any matter admitted under this rule is
conclusively established unless the court on motion permits withdrawal or
amendment of the admission. Subject to rule 12.200 governing amendment of a
pretrial order, the court may permit withdrawal or amendment when the
presentation of the merits of the action will be subserved by it and the party who
92obtained the admission fails to satisfy the court that withdrawal or amendment will
prejudice that party in maintaining an action or defense on the merits. Any
admission made by a party under this rule is for the purpose of the pending action
only and is not an admission for any other purpose nor may it be used against that
party in any other proceeding.
RULE 12.380. FAILURE TO MAKE DISCOVERY; SANCTIONS
(a) Motion for Order Compelling Discovery. On reasonable notice to
other parties and all persons affected, a party may apply for an order compelling
discovery as follows:
(1) Appropriate Court. An application for an order to a party may
be made to the court in which the action is pending or in accordance with rule
12.310(d). An application for an order to a deponent who is not a party must be
made to the circuit court where the deposition is being taken.
(2) Motion. If a deponent fails to answer a question propounded or
submitted under rule 12.310 or 12.320, or a corporation or other entity fails to
make a designation under rule 12.310(b)(6) or 12.320(a), or a party fails to answer
an interrogatory submitted under rule 12.340, or if a party in response to a request
for inspection submitted under rule 12.350 fails to respond that inspection will be
permitted as requested or fails to permit inspection as requested, or if a party in
response to a request for examination of a person submitted under rule 12.360(a)
objects to the examination, fails to respond that the examination will be permitted
as requested, or fails to submit to or to produce a person in that party’s custody or
legal control for examination, or if any person fails to comply with any discovery
request or requirement under the Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure,
including, but not limited to, the failure to comply with rule 12.285, the
discovering party may move for an order compelling an answer, or a designation or
an order compelling inspection, or an order compelling an examination in
accordance with the request. The motion must include a certification that the
movant, in good faith, has conferred or attempted to confer with the person or
party failing to make the discovery in an effort to secure the information or
material without court action. When taking a deposition on oral examination, the
proponent of the question may complete or adjourn the examination before
applying for an order. If the court denies the motion in whole or in part, it may
make such protective order as it would have been empowered to make on a motion
made under rule 12.280(d).
93(3) Evasive or Incomplete Answer. For purposes of this
subdivision an evasive or incomplete answer shall be treated as a failure to answer.
(4) Award of Expenses of Motion. If the motion is granted and
after opportunity for hearing, the court must require the party or deponent whose
conduct necessitated the motion or the party or counsel advising the conduct to pay
to the moving party the reasonable expenses incurred in obtaining the order that
may include attorneys’ fees, unless the court finds that the movant failed to certify
in the motion that a good faith effort was made to obtain the discovery without
court action, that the opposition to the motion was substantially justified, or that
other circumstances make an award of expenses unjust. If the motion is denied and
after opportunity for hearing, the court must require the moving party to pay to the
party or deponent who opposed the motion the reasonable expenses incurred in
opposing the motion that may include attorneys’ fees, unless the court finds that
the making of the motion was substantially justified or that other circumstances
make an award of expenses unjust. If the motion is granted in part and denied in
part, the court may apportion the reasonable expenses incurred as a result of
making the motion among the parties and persons.
(b) Failure to Comply with Order.
(1) If a deponent fails to be sworn or to answer a question after
being directed to do so by the court, the failure may be considered a contempt of
the court.
(2) If a party or an officer, director, or managing agent of a party or
a person designated under rule 12.310(b)(6) or 12.320(a) to testify on behalf of a
party fails to obey an order to provide or permit discovery, including an order
made under subdivision (a) of this rule or rule 12.360, the court in which the action
is pending may make any of the following orders:
(A) An order that the matters regarding which the questions
were asked or any other designated facts shall be taken to be established for the
purposes of the action in accordance with the claim of the party obtaining the
order.
(B) An order refusing to allow the disobedient party to
support or oppose designated claims or defenses, or prohibiting that party from
introducing designated matters in evidence.
94(C) An order striking out pleadings or parts of them or
staying further proceedings until the order is obeyed, or dismissing the action or
proceeding or any part of it, or rendering a judgment by default against the
disobedient party.
(D) Instead of any of the foregoing orders or in addition to
them, an order treating as a contempt of court the failure to obey any orders except
an order to submit to an examination made under rule 12.360(a)(1)(B) or
subdivision (a)(2) of this rule.
(E) When a party has failed to comply with an order under
rule 12.360(a)(1)(B) requiring that party to produce another for examination, the
orders listed in subdivisions (b)(2)(A)–(b)(2)(C), unless the party failing to comply
shows the inability to produce the person for examination.
Instead of any of the foregoing orders or in addition to them, the court
must require the party failing to obey the order to pay the reasonable expenses
caused by the failure, which may include attorneys’ fees, unless the court finds that
the failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of
expenses unjust. Alternatively, the court may defer ruling on the party’s motion for
sanctions until the conclusion of the matter in controversy.
(c) Expenses on Failure to Admit. If a party fails to admit the
genuineness of any document or the truth of any matter as requested under rule
12.370 and if the party requesting the admissions proves the genuineness of the
document or the truth of the matter, the requesting party may file a motion for an
order requiring the other party to pay the requesting party the reasonable expenses
incurred in making that proof, which may include attorneys’ fees. The court may
issue such an order at the time a party requesting the admissions proves the
genuineness of the document or the truth of the matter, upon motion by the
requesting party, unless it finds that
(1) the request was held objectionable under rule 12.370(a)(3),
(2) the admission sought was of no substantial importance, or
(3) there was other good reason for the failure to admit.
(d) Failure of Party to Attend at Own Deposition or Serve Answers to
Interrogatories or Respond to Request for Inspection. If a party or an officer,
95director, or managing agent of a party or a person designated under rule
12.310(b)(6) or 12.320(a) to testify on behalf of a party fails
(1) being served with a proper notice,
to appear before the officer who is to take the deposition after
(2) to serve answers or objections to interrogatories submitted
under rule 12.340 after proper service of the interrogatories, or
(3) to serve a written response to a request for inspection submitted
under rule 12.350 after proper service of the request, the court in which the action
is pending may take any action authorized under subdivisions (b)(2)(A)–(b)(2)(C)
of this rule.
Any motion specifying a failure under subdivisions (d)(2) or (d)(3) must
include a certification that the movant, in good faith, has conferred or attempted to
confer with the party failing to answer or respond in an effort to obtain such
answer or response without court action. Instead of any order or in addition to it,
the court may require the party failing to act to pay the reasonable expenses caused
by the failure, which may include attorneys’ fees, unless the court finds that the
failure was substantially justified or that other circumstances make an award of
expenses unjust. The failure to act described in this subdivision may not be
excused on the ground that the discovery sought is objectionable unless the party
failing to act has applied for a protective order as provided by rule 12.280(d).
(e) Electronically Stored Information; Sanctions for Failure to
Preserve. Absent exceptional circumstances, a court may not impose sanctions
under these rules on a party for failing to provide electronically stored information
lost as a result of the routine, good faith operation of an electronic information
system.
RULE 12.390. DEPOSITIONS OF EXPERT WITNESSES
(a) Definition. The term “expert witness” as used herein applies
exclusively to a person duly and regularly engaged in the practice of a profession
who holds a professional degree from a university or college and has had special
professional training and experience, or one possessed of special knowledge or
skill about the subject upon which called to testify.
(b) Procedure. The testimony of an expert or skilled witness may be
taken at any time before the trial in accordance with the rules for taking
96depositions and may be used at trial, regardless of the place of residence of the
witness or whether the witness is within the distance prescribed by rule
12.330(a)(3)(B). No special form of notice need be given that the deposition will
be used for trial.
(c) Fee. An expert or skilled witness whose deposition is taken must be
allowed a witness fee in such reasonable amount as the court may determine. The
court must also determine a reasonable time within which payment must be made,
if the deponent and party cannot agree. All parties and the deponent must be served
with notice of any hearing to determine the fee. Any reasonable fee paid to an
expert or skilled witness may be taxed as costs.
(d) Applicability. Nothing in this rule prevents the taking of any
deposition as otherwise provided by law.
RULE 12.400. CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS AND
PROCEEDINGS
(a) Closure of Proceedings or Records. Closure of court proceedings or
sealing of records may be ordered by the court only as provided by Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.420.
(b) In Camera Inspections. The court shall conduct an in camera
inspection of any records sought to be sealed and consider the contents of the
records in determining whether they should be sealed.
(c) Conditional Sealing of Financial Information.
(1) The court has the authority to conditionally seal the financial
information required by rule 12.285 if it is likely that access to the information
would subject a party to abuse, such as the use of the information by third parties
for purposes unrelated to government or judicial accountability or to first
amendment rights. Any such order sealing the financial information is conditional
in that the information shall be disclosed to any person who establishes that
disclosure of the information is necessary for government or judicial accountability
or has a proper first amendment right to the information.
(2) Notice of conditional sealing shall be as required by Florida
Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420(d).
97(3) Upon receipt of a motion to reopen conditionally sealed
financial information, the court shall schedule a hearing on the motion with notice
provided to the movant and parties.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. Judicial proceedings and records should be public except
when substantial compelling circumstances, especially the protection of children or
of business trade secrets, require otherwise. Family law matters frequently present
such circumstances. It is intended that this rule be applied to protect the interests of
minor children from offensive testimony and to protect children in a divorce
proceeding.
2003 Amendment. The adoption of a procedure for conditional sealing of
the financial information does not change the burden of proof for closure of filed
records of court proceedings set forth in Barron v. Florida Freedom Newspapers,
Inc., 531 So.2d 113, 118 (Fla. 1988).
RULE 12.407. TESTIMONY AND ATTENDANCE OF MINOR CHILD
No minor child shall be deposed or brought to a deposition, brought to court
to appear as a witness or to attend a hearing, or subpoenaed to appear at a hearing
without prior order of the court based on good cause shown unless in an
emergency situation. This provision shall not apply to uncontested adoption
proceedings.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule is intended to afford additional protection to
minor children by avoiding any unnecessary involvement of children in family law
litigation. While due process considerations prohibit an absolute ban on child
testimony, this rule requires that a judge determine whether a child’s testimony is
necessary and relevant to issues before the court prior to a child being required to
testify.
RULE 12.410. SUBPOENA
(a) Subpoenas Generally. Subpoenas for testimony before the court,
subpoenas for production of tangible evidence, and subpoenas for taking
depositions may be issued by the clerk of court or by any attorney of record in an
action. No subpoena issued under this rule, even if for the purpose of proof of
98service or nonservice of the subpoena, shall be filed with the court unless in
compliance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425.
(b) Subpoena for Testimony Before the Court.
(1) Every subpoena for testimony before the court must be issued
by an attorney of record in an action or by the clerk under the seal of the court and
must state the name of the court and the title of the action and must command each
person to whom it is directed to attend and give testimony at a time and place
specified in it.
(2) On oral request of an attorney or party, the clerk must issue a
subpoena for testimony before the court or a subpoena for the production of
documentary evidence before the court signed and sealed but otherwise in blank,
both as to the title of the action and the name of the person to whom it is directed,
and the subpoena must be filled in before service by the attorney or party.
(c) For Production of Documentary Evidence.
(1) Generally. A subpoena may also command the person to whom
it is directed to produce the books, papers, documents (including electronically
stored information), or tangible things designated therein, but the court, on motion
made promptly and in any event at or before the time specified in the subpoena for
compliance with it, may
(A) quash or modify the subpoena if it is unreasonable and
oppressive, or
(B) condition denial of the motion upon the advancement by
the person in whose behalf the subpoena is issued of the reasonable cost of
producing the books, papers, documents, or tangible things.
A party seeking a production of evidence at trial which would be
subject to a subpoena may compel such production by serving a notice to produce
such evidence on an adverse party as provided in rule 12.080(b). Such notice shall
have the same effect and be subject to the same limitations as a subpoena served on
the party.
(2) Compliance with Rule 2.425. Any notice to produce issued
under this rule must comply with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425.
99(d) Service.
(1) Generally. A subpoena may be served by any person
authorized by law to serve process or by any other person who is not a party and
who is not less than 18 years of age. Service of a subpoena on a person named in it
shall be made as provided by law. Proof of such service shall be made by affidavit
of the person making service if not served by an officer authorized by law to do so.
(2) Notice of Subpoena to Parties. A party issuing a subpoena
through an attorney of record or clerk of the court under this rule must, on the same
day as the subpoena is served, serve each party to the proceeding with a notice of
issuance of subpoena and file this notice with the court. The notice of issuance of
subpoena must identify the person or entity subject to the subpoena, the date the
subpoena was issued, and the date and time for appearance or production, and must
recite that all references to account numbers or personal identifying numbers are in
compliance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425. An unexecuted
copy of the subpoena to be issued must be attached to the Notice of Subpoena.
(e) Subpoena for Taking Depositions.
(1) Filing a notice to take a deposition as provided in rule
12.310(b) or 12.320(a) with a certificate of service on it showing service on all
parties to the action constitutes an authorization for the issuance of subpoenas for
the persons named or described in the notice by the clerk of the court in which the
action is pending or by an attorney of record in the action. The subpoena may
command the person to whom it is directed to produce designated books, papers,
documents, or tangible things that constitute or contain evidence relating to any of
the matters within the scope of the examination permitted by rule 12.280(c), but in
that event the subpoena will be subject to the provisions of rule 12.280(d) and
subdivision (c) of this rule. Within 10 days after its service, or on or before the
time specified in the subpoena for compliance if the time is less than 10 days after
service, the person to whom the subpoena is directed may serve written objection
to inspection or copying of any of the designated materials. If objection is made,
the party serving the subpoena shall not be entitled to inspect and copy the
materials except pursuant to an order of the court from which the subpoena was
issued. If objection has been made, the party serving the subpoena may move for
an order at any time before or during the taking of the deposition upon notice to the
deponent.
100(2) A person may be required to attend an examination only in the
county in which the person resides or is employed or transacts business in person
or at such other convenient place as may be fixed by an order of court.
(f) Contempt. Failure by any person without adequate excuse to obey a
subpoena served on that person may be deemed a contempt of the court from
which the subpoena issued.
(g) Depositions before Commissioners Appointed in this State by
Courts of Other States; Subpoena Powers; etc. When any person authorized by
the laws of Florida to administer oaths is appointed by a court of record of any
other state, jurisdiction, or government as commissioner to take the testimony of
any named witness within this state, that witness may be compelled to attend and
testify before that commissioner by witness subpoena issued by the clerk of any
circuit court at the instance of that commissioner or by other process or
proceedings in the same manner as if that commissioner had been appointed by a
court of this state; provided that no document or paper writing shall be
compulsorily annexed as an exhibit to such deposition or otherwise permanently
removed from the possession of the witness producing it, but in lieu thereof a copy
may be annexed to and transmitted with such executed commission to the court of
issuance.
(h) Subpoena of Minor. Any minor subpoenaed for testimony has the
right to be accompanied by a parent, guardian, guardian ad litem, or attorney ad
litem at all times during the taking of testimony notwithstanding the invocation of
the rule of sequestration of section 90.616, Florida Statutes, except on a showing
that the presence of a parent or guardian is likely to have a material, negative
impact on the credibility or accuracy of the minor’s testimony, or that the interests
of the parent or guardian are in actual or potential conflict with the interests of the
minor. The provisions of this subdivision do not alter the requirements of rule
12.407 that a court order must be obtained before a minor child may be
subpoenaed to appear at a hearing.
Committee Note
2008 Amendment. The provisions of Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.410(h) do not alter
the requirements of rule 12.407 that a court order must be obtained before a minor
child may be subpoenaed to appear at a hearing.
2012 Amendment. This rule is amended to provide for service in
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
101RULE 12.420. DISMISSAL OF ACTIONS
(a) Voluntary Dismissal.
(1) By Parties. An action or a claim may be dismissed
(A) before trial by serving, or during trial by stating on the
record, a notice of dismissal at any time before a hearing on motion for summary
judgment, or if none is served or if the motion is denied, before retirement of the
jury in a case tried before a jury or before submission of a nonjury case to the court
for decision; or
(B) by filing a stipulation of dismissal signed by all current
parties to the action.
(2) By Order of Court; Counterpetition. Except as provided in
subdivision (a)(1), an action may not be dismissed at a party’s request except on
order of the court and on such terms and conditions as the court deems proper. If
the petitioner files a notice of dismissal of the original petition after a
counterpetition is served by the respondent, the counterpetition shall not be
automatically dismissed.
(3) Adjudication on the Merits. Unless otherwise specified in a
notice of stipulation, a voluntary dismissal is without prejudice and does not
operate as an adjudication on the merits.
(b) Involuntary Dismissal. Any party may move for dismissal of an
action or of any claim against that party for failure of an adverse party to comply
with these rules or any order of court. After a party seeking affirmative relief in an
action has completed the presentation of evidence, any other party may move for a
dismissal on the ground that on the facts and the law the party seeking affirmative
relief has shown no right to relief, without waiving the right to offer evidence if the
motion is not granted. Involuntary dismissal for lack of jurisdiction, improper
venue, or lack of an indispensable party does not act as an adjudication on the
merits. All other involuntary dismissals operate as an adjudication on the merits,
unless otherwise specified by the court.
(c) Costs. Costs shall be assessed, except that the court may not require
the payment of costs of a previously dismissed claim, which was based on or
included the same claim against the same adverse party as the current action.
102(d) Failure to Prosecute. In all actions in which it appears on the face of
the record that for a period of 10 months, no activity by filing of pleadings or order
of court has occurred, and no order staying the action has been issued nor
stipulation for stay approved by the court, any interested person, whether a party to
the action or not, the court, or the clerk of the court may serve notice to all parties
that no such activity has occurred. If no such record activity has occurred within
the 10 months immediately preceding the service of the notice, and no record
activity occurs within 60 days immediately following the service of the notice, and
if no stay was issued or approved before the expiration of the 60-day period, the
action must be dismissed by the court on its own motion or on the motion of any
interested person, whether a party to the action or not, after reasonable notice to the
parties, unless a party shows good cause in writing at least 5 days before the
hearing on the motion why the action should remain pending. Mere inaction for a
period of less than 1 year is not sufficient cause for dismissal for failure to
prosecute.
(e) Effect on Lis Pendens. If a notice of lis pendens has been filed in
connection with a claim for affirmative relief that is dismissed under this rule, the
notice of lis pendens connected with the dismissed claim is automatically dissolved
at the same time. The notice, stipulation, or order must be recorded.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. Subdivision (a), which amends Florida Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.420(a)(1), was added to eliminate the language of that subdivision
which reads “except that a notice of dismissal operates as an adjudication on the
merits when served by a plaintiff who has once dismissed in any court an action
based on or including the same claim” and to specifically provide to the contrary.
Subdivision (b), which amends rule 1.420(d), was added to prevent the
discouragement of reconciliation.
RULE 12.430. DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL; WAIVER
(a) Right Preserved. The right of trial by jury as declared by the
Constitution or by statute must be preserved to the parties inviolate.
(b) Demand. Any party may demand a trial by jury of any issue triable of
right by a jury by serving on the other party a demand in writing at any time after
commencement of the action and not later than 10 days after the service of the last
pleading directed to such issue. The demand may be endorsed on a pleading of the
party.
103(c) Specification of Issues. In the demand, a party may specify the issues
that the party would like tried; otherwise, the party is deemed to demand trial by
jury for all issues so triable. If a party has demanded trial by jury for only some of
the issues, any other party may serve a demand for trial by jury of any other or all
of the issues triable by jury 10 days after service of the demand or such lesser time
as the court may order.
(d) Waiver. A party who fails to serve a demand as required by this rule
waives trial by jury. If waived, a jury trial may not be granted without the consent
of the parties, but the court may allow an amendment in the proceedings to demand
a trial by jury or order a trial by jury on its own motion. A demand for trial by jury
may not be withdrawn without the consent of the parties.
RULE 12.431. JURY TRIAL
(a) this rule governs those proceedings.
Generally. In those family law cases in which a jury trial is available,
(b) Questionnaire.
(1) The circuit court may direct the authority charged by law with
the selection of prospective jurors to furnish each prospective juror with a
questionnaire in the form approved by the supreme court from time to time to
assist the authority in selecting prospective jurors. The questionnaire must be used
after the names of jurors have been selected as provided by law but before
certification and the placing of the names of prospective jurors in the jury box. The
questionnaire must be used to determine those who are not qualified to serve as
jurors under any statutory ground of disqualification.
(2) To assist in voir dire examination at trial, any court may direct
the clerk to furnish prospective jurors selected for service with a questionnaire in
the form approved by the supreme court from time to time. The prospective jurors
shall be asked to complete and return the forms. Completed forms may be
inspected in the clerk’s office and copies must be available in court during the voir
dire examination for use by parties and the court.
(c) Examination by Parties. The parties have the right to examine jurors
orally on their voir dire. The order in which the parties may examine each juror is
determined by the court. The court may ask such questions of the jurors as it deems
necessary, but the right of the parties to conduct a reasonable examination of each
juror orally must be preserved.
104(d) Challenge for Cause.
(1) On motion of any party, the court must examine any
prospective juror on oath to determine whether that person is related, within the
third degree, to (A) any party, (B) the attorney of any party, or (C) any other
person or entity against whom liability or blame is alleged in the pleadings, or is
related to any person alleged to have been wronged or injured by the commission
of the wrong for the trial of which the juror is called, or has any interest in the
action, or has formed or expressed any opinion, or is sensible of any bias or
prejudice concerning it, or is an employee or has been an employee of any party or
any other person or entity against whom liability or blame is alleged in the
pleadings, within 30 days before the trial. A party objecting to the juror may
introduce any other competent evidence to support the objection. If it appears that
the juror does not stand indifferent to the action or any of the foregoing grounds of
objection exists or that the juror is otherwise incompetent, another must be called
in that juror’s place.
(2) The fact that any person selected for jury duty from bystanders
or the body of the county and not from a jury list lawfully selected has served as a
juror in the court in which that person is called at any other time within 1 year is a
ground of challenge for cause.
(3) When the nature of any action requires a knowledge of reading,
writing, and arithmetic, or any of them, to enable a juror to understand the
evidence to be offered, the fact that any prospective juror does not possess the
qualifications is a ground of challenge for cause.
(e) Peremptory Challenges. Each party is entitled to 3 peremptory
challenges of jurors, but when the number of parties on opposite sides is unequal,
the opposing parties are entitled to the same aggregate number of peremptory
challenges to be determined on the basis of 3 peremptory challenges to each party
on the side with the greater number of parties. The additional peremptory
challenges accruing to multiple parties on the opposing side must be divided
equally among them. Any additional peremptory challenges not capable of equal
division must be exercised separately or jointly as determined by the court.
(f) Exercise of Challenges. All challenges must be addressed to the court
outside the hearing of the jury in a manner selected by the court so that the jury
panel is not aware of the nature of the challenge, the party making the challenge, or
the basis of the court’s ruling on the challenge, if for cause.
105(g) Swearing of Jurors. No one may be sworn as a juror until the jury
has been accepted by the parties or until all challenges have been exhausted.
(h) Alternate Jurors.
(1) The court may direct that 1 or 2 jurors be impaneled to sit as
alternate jurors in addition to the regular panel. Alternate jurors in the order in
which they are called must replace jurors who have become unable or disqualified
to perform their duties before the jury retires to consider its verdict. Alternate
jurors must be drawn in the same manner, have the same qualifications, be subject
to the same examination, take the same oath, and have the same functions, powers,
facilities, and privileges as principal jurors. An alternate juror who does not replace
a principal juror must be discharged when the jury retires to consider the verdict.
(2) If alternate jurors are called, each party is entitled to 1
peremptory challenge in the selection of the alternate juror or jurors, but when the
number of parties on opposite sides is unequal, the opposing parties are entitled to
the same aggregate number of peremptory challenges to be determined on the basis
of 1 peremptory challenge to each party on the side with the greater number of
parties. The additional peremptory challenges allowed under this subdivision may
be used only against the alternate jurors. The peremptory challenges allowed under
subdivision (e) may not be used against the alternate jurors.
(i) Interview of a Juror. A party who believes that grounds for legal
challenge to a verdict exist may move for an order permitting an interview of a
juror or jurors to determine whether the verdict is subject to the challenge. The
motion must be served within 10 days after rendition of the verdict unless good
cause is shown for the failure to make the motion within that time. The motion
must state the name and address of each juror to be interviewed and the grounds
for challenge that the party believes may exist. After notice and hearing, the trial
judge must enter an order denying the motion or permitting the interview. If the
interview is permitted, the court may prescribe the place, manner, conditions, and
scope of the interview.
(j) Communication with the Jury. This rule governs all communication
between the judge or courtroom personnel and jurors.
(1) Communication to be on the Record. The court must notify
the parties of any communication from the jury pertaining to the action as promptly
as practicable and in any event before responding to the communication. Except as
set forth below, all communications between the court or courtroom personnel and
106the jury must be on the record in open court or must be in writing and filed in the
action. The court or courtroom personnel must note on any written communication
to or from the jury the date and time it was delivered.
(2) Exception for Certain Routine Communication. The court
may, by pretrial order or by statement on the record with opportunity for objection,
set forth the scope of routine ex parte communication to be permitted and the limits
imposed by the court with regard to such communication.
(A) Routine ex parte communication between the bailiff or
other courtroom personnel and the jurors, limited to juror comfort and safety, may
occur off the record.
(B) In no event shall ex parte communication between
courtroom personnel and jurors extend to matters that may affect the outcome of
the trial, including statements containing any fact or opinion concerning a party,
attorney, or procedural matter or relating to any legal issue or lawsuit.
(3) Instructions to Jury. During voir dire, the court must instruct
the jurors and courtroom personnel regarding the limitations on communication
between the court or courtroom personnel and jurors. Upon empanelling the jury,
the court must instruct the jurors that their questions are to be submitted in writing
to the court, which will review them with the parties and counsel before
responding.
(4) Notification of Jury Communication. Courtroom personnel
must immediately notify the court of any communication to or from a juror or
among jurors in contravention of the court’s orders or instructions, including all
communication contrary to the requirements of this rule.
RULE 12.440. SETTING ACTION FOR TRIAL
(a) When at Issue. An action is at issue after any motions directed to the
last pleading served have been disposed of or, if no such motions are served, 20
days after service of the last pleading. The party entitled to serve motions directed
to the last pleading may waive the right to do so by filing a notice for trial at any
time after the last pleading is served. The existence of crossclaims among the
parties shall not prevent the court from setting the action for trial on the issues
raised by the petition, counterpetition, and answer.
107(b) Notice for Trial. Any party may file and serve a notice that the action
is at issue and ready to be set for trial. The notice must include an estimate of the
time required and whether the trial is on the original action or a subsequent
proceeding. The clerk must then submit the notice and the case file to the court. If
there are any issues to be tried by jury, the notice for trial must so state.
(c) Setting for Trial. If the court finds the action ready to be set for trial,
it shall enter an order setting the action for trial, fixing a date for trial, and setting a
pretrial conference, if necessary. In the event a default has been entered, reasonable
notice of not less than 10 days shall be given unless otherwise required by law. In
actions in which the damages are not liquidated, the order setting an action for trial
shall be served on parties who are in default in accordance with Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.516. Trial shall be set within a reasonable time from the
service of the notice for trial. At the pretrial conference, the parties should be
prepared, consistent with rule 12.200, to present any matter that will prepare the
parties for trial and that can expedite the resolution of the case. The trial court may
also direct the parties to reciprocally exchange and file with the court all
documents relative to the outcome of the case; a list of all witnesses, all issues to
be tried, and all undisposed motions; an estimate of the time needed to try the case;
and any other information the court deems appropriate. Any court filings shall be
in conformity with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425. This information
should be served and filed no later than 72 hours before the pretrial conference or
30 days before the trial.
(d) sanctions.
Sanctions. The failure to comply with the requirements of the order
setting the action for trial subjects the party or attorney to appropriate court
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule amends Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.440(c),
Setting for Trial, and creates a procedure to facilitate setting an action for trial.
Proper pretrial compliance will foster knowledgeable settlement discussion and
expedite an orderly trial. The rule also adds a provision for sanctions.
RULE 12.450. EVIDENCE
(a) Record of Excluded Evidence. If, during trial, an objection to a
question propounded to a witness is sustained by the trier of fact, the examining
attorney may make a specific offer of what the attorney expects to prove by the
answer of the witness. The court may add such other and further statement as
108clearly shows the character of the evidence, the form in which it was offered, the
objection made, and the ruling thereon. The court on request must take and report
the evidence in full unless it clearly appears that the evidence is not admissible on
any ground or is privileged. The court may require the offer to be made outside the
hearing of the trier of fact.
(b) Filing. When documentary evidence is introduced in an action, the
clerk or the judge must endorse an identifying number or symbol on it and when
proffered or admitted in evidence, it must be filed by the clerk or judge and
considered in the custody of the court and not withdrawn except with written leave
of court.
RULE 12.451. TAKING TESTIMONY
(a) procedure.
Testimony at Hearing or Trial. When testifying at a hearing or trial,
a witness must be physically present unless otherwise provided by law or rule of
(b) Communication Equipment. The court may permit a witness to
testify at a hearing or trial by contemporaneous audio or video communication
equipment (1) by agreement of the parties or (2) for good cause shown upon
written request of a party upon reasonable notice to all other parties. The request
and notice must contain the substance of the proposed testimony and an estimate of
the length of the proposed testimony. In considering sufficient good cause, the
court shall weigh and address in its order the reasons stated for testimony by
communication equipment against the potential for prejudice to the objecting party.
(c) Required Equipment. Communication equipment as used in this rule
means a conference telephone or other electronic device that permits all those
appearing or participating to hear and speak to each other simultaneously and
permits all conversations of all parties to be audible to all persons present.
Contemporaneous video communication equipment must make the witness visible
to all participants during the testimony. For testimony by any of the foregoing
means, there must be appropriate safeguards for the court to maintain sufficient
control over the equipment and the transmission of the testimony, so that the court
may stop the communication to accommodate objection or prevent prejudice.
(d) Oath. Testimony may be taken through communication equipment
only if a notary public or other person authorized to administer oaths in the
witness’s jurisdiction is present with the witness and administers the oath
consistent with the laws of that jurisdiction.
109(e) the court.
Burden of Expense. The cost for the use of the communication
equipment is the responsibility of the requesting party unless otherwise ordered by
RULE 12.460. CONTINUANCES
Continuances are governed by Florida Rule of Judicial Administration
2.545(e). If a continuance is sought on the ground of nonavailability of a witness,
the motion must show when it is believed the witness will be available.
RULE 12.470. EXCEPTIONS
(a) Adverse Ruling. For appellate purposes no exception shall be
necessary to any adverse ruling, order, instruction, or thing whatsoever said or
done at the trial or prior to the trial or after the verdict, which was said or done
after objection made and considered by the trial court and which affected the
substantial rights of the party complaining and which is assigned as error, other
than as provided by rules 12.490 and 12.492.
(b) Instructions to Jury. The Florida Standard Jury Instructions
appearing on the court’s website at
www.floridasupremecourt.org/jury_instructions.shtml must be used by the trial
judges of this state in instructing the jury in civil actions to the extent that the
Standard Jury Instructions are applicable, unless the trial judge determines that an
applicable Standard Jury Instruction is erroneous or inadequate. If the trial judge
modifies a Standard Jury Instruction or gives such other instruction as the judge
determines necessary to accurately and sufficiently instruct the jury, on timely
objection to the instruction, the trial judge must state on the record or in a separate
order the legal basis for varying from the Standard Jury Instruction. Similarly, in
all circumstances in which the notes accompanying the Florida Standard Jury
Instructions contain a recommendation that a certain type of instruction not be
given, the trial judge must follow the recommendation unless the judge determines
that the giving of such an instruction is necessary to accurately and sufficiently
instruct the jury, in which event the judge must give such instruction as the judge
deems appropriate and necessary. If the trial judge does not follow such a
recommendation of the Florida Standard Jury Instructions, on timely objection to
the instruction, the trial judge must state on the record or in a separate order the
legal basis of the determination that such instruction is necessary. Not later than at
the close of the evidence, the parties may file written requests that the court
instruct the jury on the law set forth in such requests. The court may then require
110counsel to appear before it to settle the instructions to be given. At such
conference, all objections must be made and ruled on and the court must inform
counsel of such instructions as the court will give. No party may assign as error the
giving of any instruction unless that party objects thereto at such time, or the
failure to give any instruction unless that party requested the same. The court shall
orally instruct the jury before or after the arguments of counsel and may provide
appropriate instructions during the trial. If the instructions are given before final
argument, the presiding judge must give the jury final procedural instructions after
final arguments are concluded and before deliberations. The court must provide
each juror with a written set of the instructions for his or her use in deliberations.
The court must file a copy of such instructions.
(c) Orders on New Trial; Directed Verdicts; etc. It shall not be
necessary to object or except to any order granting or denying motions for new
trials, directed verdicts, or judgments notwithstanding the verdict or in arrest of
judgment to entitle the party against whom such ruling is made to have the same
reviewed by an appellate court.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule amends subdivision (a) of rule 1.470 as it applies
to family law matters to eliminate possible confusion between common law
exceptions and exceptions to recommendations of a general master under rule
12.490 or a special master under rule 12.492.
RULE 12.480. MOTION FOR A DIRECTED VERDICT
(a) Effect. A party who moves for a directed verdict at the close of the
evidence offered by the adverse party may offer evidence in the event the motion is
denied without having reserved the right to do so and to the same extent as if the
motion had not been made. The denial of a motion for a directed verdict shall not
operate to discharge the jury, if applicable. A motion for a directed verdict must
state the specific grounds for it. The order directing a verdict is effective without
any assent of the jury, if applicable.
(b) Reservation of Decision on Motion. When a motion for a directed
verdict is denied or for any reason is not granted, the court is deemed to have
submitted the action to the jury, if applicable, subject to a later determination of the
legal questions raised by the motion. Within 15 days after the return of a verdict, a
party who has timely moved for a directed verdict may serve a motion to set aside
the verdict and any judgment entered on it and to enter judgment in accordance
111with the motion for a directed verdict. If a verdict was not returned, a party who
has timely moved for a directed verdict may serve a motion for judgment in
accordance with the motion for a directed verdict within 15 days after discharge of
the jury, if applicable.
(c) Joined with Motion for New Trial or Motion for Rehearing. A
motion for a new trial or motion for rehearing may be joined with a motion for
directed verdict or a new trial may be requested in the alternative. If a verdict was
returned, the court may allow the judgment to stand or may reopen the judgment
and either order a new trial or rehearing, or direct the entry of judgment as if the
requested verdict had been directed. If no verdict was returned, the court may
direct the entry of judgment as if the requested verdict had been directed or may
order a new trial or rehearing.

apply to the court for an order to the general magistrate to speed the proceedings
and to make the report and to certify to the court the reason for any delay.
(2) The general magistrate shall take testimony and establish a
record which may be by electronic means as provided by Florida Rule of Judicial

BE DENIED. A RECORD ORDINARILY INCLUDES A WRITTEN
TRANSCRIPT OF ALL RELEVANT PROCEEDINGS. THE PERSON
SEEKING REVIEW MUST HAVE THE TRANSCRIPT PREPARED
IF NECESSARY FOR THE COURT’S REVIEW.
(5) The notice or order setting a matter for hearing shall state

party shall promptly file a notice setting forth the portions of the transcript that
have been ordered. The responding parties shall be permitted to designate any
additional portions of the transcript necessary to the adjudication of the issues
raised in the exceptions or cross-exceptions.
(3) The cost of the original and all copies of the transcript of the
proceedings shall be borne initially by the party seeking review, subject to
appropriate assessment of suit monies. Should any portion of the transcript be
required as a result of a designation filed by the responding party, the party making
the designation shall bear the initial cost of the additional transcript.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule is a modification of Florida Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.490. That rule governed the appointment of both general and special
masters. The appointment of special masters is now governed by Florida Family
Law Rule of Procedure 12.492. This rule is intended to clarify procedures that
were required under rule 1.490, and it creates additional procedures. The use of
general masters should be implemented only when such use will reduce costs and
expedite cases in accordance with Dralus v. Dralus, 627 So.2d 505 (Fla. 2d DCA
1993), Wrona v. Wrona, 592 So.2d 694 (Fla. 2d DCA 1991), and Katz v. Katz, 505
So.2d 25 (Fla. 4th DCA 1987).
Committee Notes
2004 Amendment. In accordance with Chapter 2004-11, Laws of Florida,
all references to general master were changed to general magistrate.
2015 Amendment. Subdivision (b)(3) has been amended to clarify that the
order of referral must include the name of the specific general magistrate to whom
the matter is being referred and who will conduct the hearing and that concurrent
referrals to multiple general magistrates is inappropriate.
RULE 12.491. CHILD SUPPORT ENFORCEMENT
(a) Limited Application. This rule shall be effective only when
specifically invoked by administrative order of the chief justice for use in a
particular county or circuit.
(b) Scope. This rule shall apply to proceedings for
116(1) the establishment, enforcement, or modification of child
support, or
(2) the enforcement of any support order for the parent or
other person entitled to receive child support in conjunction with an ongoing child
support or child support arrearage order,
when a party seeking support is receiving services pursuant to Title IV-D of the
Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 651 et seq.) and to non-Title IV-D proceedings
upon administrative order of the chief justice.
(c) Support Enforcement Hearing Officers. The chief judge of each
judicial circuit shall appoint such number of support enforcement hearing officers
for the circuit or any county within the circuit as are necessary to expeditiously
perform the duties prescribed by this rule. A hearing officer shall be a member of
The Florida Bar unless waived by the chief justice and shall serve at the pleasure of
the chief judge and a majority of the circuit judges in the circuit.
(d) Referral. Upon the filing of a cause of action or other proceeding for
the establishment, enforcement, or modification of support to which this rule
applies, the court or clerk of the circuit court shall refer such proceedings to a
support enforcement hearing officer, pursuant to procedures to be established by
administrative order of the chief judge.
(e) General Powers and Duties. The support enforcement hearing
officer shall be empowered to issue process, administer oaths, require the
production of documents, and conduct hearings for the purpose of taking evidence.
A support enforcement hearing officer does not have the authority to hear
contested paternity cases. Upon the receipt of a support proceeding, the support
enforcement hearing officer shall:
(1) assign a time and place for an appropriate hearing and give
notice to each of the parties as may be required by law;
(2) take testimony and establish a record, which record may be by
electronic means as provided by Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.535(h);
(3) accept voluntary acknowledgment of paternity and support
liability and stipulated agreements setting the amount of support to be paid; and
117(4) evaluate the evidence and promptly make a recommended order
to the court. Such order shall set forth findings of fact.
(f) Entry of Order and Relief from Order. Upon receipt of a
recommended order, the court shall review the recommended order and shall enter
an order promptly unless good cause appears to amend the order, conduct further
proceedings, or refer the matter back to the hearing officer to conduct further
proceedings. Any party affected by the order may move to vacate the order by
filing a motion to vacate within 10 days from the date of entry. Any party may file
a cross-motion to vacate within 5 days of service of a motion to vacate, provided,
however, that the filing of a cross-motion to vacate shall not delay the hearing on
the motion to vacate unless good cause is shown. A motion to vacate the order
shall be heard within 10 days after the movant applies for hearing on the motion.
(g) Modification of Order. Any party affected by the order may move to
modify the order at any time.
(h) Record. For the purpose of hearing on a motion to vacate, a record,
substantially in conformity with this rule, shall be provided to the court by the
party seeking review.
(1) The record shall consist of the court file, including the
transcript of the proceedings before the hearing officer, if filed, and all depositions
and evidence presented to the hearing officer.
(2) The transcript of all relevant proceedings shall be delivered to
the judge and provided to opposing counsel not less than 48 hours before the
hearing on the motion to vacate. If less than a full transcript of the proceedings
taken before the hearing officer is ordered prepared by the moving party, that party
shall promptly file a notice setting forth the portions of the transcript that have
been ordered. The responding party shall be permitted to designate any additional
portions of the transcript necessary to the adjudication of the issues raised in the
motion to vacate or cross-motion to vacate.
(3) The cost of the original and all copies of the transcript of the
proceedings shall be borne initially by the party seeking review, subject to
appropriate assessment of suit monies. Should any portion of the transcript be
required as a result of a designation filed by the responding party, the party making
the designation shall bear the initial cost of the additional transcript.
Commentary
1181995 Adoption. Previously, this rule was contained in Florida Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.491. The new rule is substantially the same as previous rule 1.491,
with the following additions.
It is intended that any administrative order issued by the chief justice of the
Florida Supreme Court under rule 1.491(a) shall remain in full force and effect as
though such order was rendered under this rule until changed by order of that same
court.
Subdivision (e) now makes clear that contested paternity cases are not to be
heard by support enforcement hearing officers.
Subdivision (h) has been added to provide requirements for a record.
1988 Adoption. Title: The terminology “hearing officer” is used rather than
“master” to avoid confusion or conflict with rule 1.490.
Subdivision (a): The rule is intended as a fall back mechanism to be used by
the chief justice as the need may arise.
Subdivision (b): The expedited process provisions of the applicable federal
regulations apply only to matters which fall within the purview of Title IV-D. The
committee recognizes, however, that the use of hearing officers could provide a
useful case flow management tool in non-Title IV-D support proceedings.
It is contemplated that a circuit could make application to the chief justice
for expansion of the scope of the rule upon a showing of necessity and good cause.
It is the position of the representative of the Family Law Section of The Florida
Bar that reference of non-Title IV-D proceedings should require the consent of the
parties as is required by rule 1.490(c).
Subdivision (c): It is the position of the committee that hearing officers
should be members of the Bar in that jurisdictional and other legal issues are likely
to arise in proceedings of this nature. The waiver provision is directed to small
counties in which it may be difficult or impossible to find a lawyer willing to serve
and to such other special circumstances as may be determined by the chief justice.
Subdivision (d): This paragraph recognizes that the mechanics of reference
and operation of a program are best determined at the local level.
Subdivision (e): This paragraph is intended to empower the hearing officer
to fully carry out his or her responsibilities without becoming overly complicated.
The authority to enter defaults which is referred to in the federal regulations is
omitted, the committee feeling that the subject matter is fully and adequately
119covered by rule 1.500.
The authority to accept voluntary acknowledgments of paternity is included
at the request of the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services. Findings of
fact are included in the recommended order to provide the judge to whom the order
is referred basic information relating to the subject matter.
Subdivision (f): Expedited process is intended to eliminate or minimize
delays which are perceived to exist in the normal processing of cases. This
paragraph is intended to require the prompt entry of an order and to guarantee due
process to the obligee.
General Note: This proposed rule, in substantially the same form, was
circulated to each of the chief judges for comment. Five responses were received.
Two responding endorsed the procedure, and 3 responding felt that any rule of this
kind would be inappropriate. The committee did not address the question of
funding, which included not only salaries of hearing officers and support
personnel, but also capital outlay for furniture, fixtures, equipment and space, and
normal operating costs. The committee recognizes that the operational costs of
such programs may be substantial and recommends that this matter be addressed
by an appropriate body.
Committee Note
1998 Amendment. This rule shall not apply to proceedings to establish or
modify alimony.
RULE 12.492. SPECIAL MAGISTRATES
(a) Special Magistrates. The court may appoint members of The Florida
Bar as special magistrates for any particular service required by the court in a
family law matter other than those involving injunctions for protection against
domestic, repeat, dating, and sexual violence, and stalking. The special magistrates
shall be governed by all the provisions of law and rules relating to general
magistrates except as otherwise provided by this rule. Additionally, they shall not
be required to make oath or give bond unless specifically required by the order
appointing them. Upon a showing that the appointment is advisable, a person other
than a member of The Florida Bar may be appointed.
(b) Reference. No reference shall be to a special magistrate without the
express prior consent of the parties, except that the court upon good cause shown
120and without consent of the parties may appoint an attorney as a special magistrate
to preside over depositions and rule upon objections.
(c) General Powers and Duties. Every special magistrate shall perform
all of the duties that pertain to the office according to the practice in chancery and
rules of court and under the direction of the court. Hearings before any special
magistrate shall be held in the county where the action is pending, but hearings
may be held at any place by order of the court within or without the state to meet
the convenience of the witnesses or the parties. All grounds for disqualification of
a judge shall apply to special magistrates.
(d) Bond. When not otherwise provided by law, the court may require
special magistrates who are appointed to dispose of real or personal property to
give bond and surety conditioned for the proper payment of all moneys that may
come into their hands and for the due performance of their duties as the court may
direct. The bond shall be made payable to the State of Florida and shall be for the
benefit of all persons aggrieved by any act of the special magistrate.
(e) Hearings. When a reference is made to a special magistrate, any party
or the special magistrate may set the action for hearing. The special magistrate
shall assign a time and place for proceedings as soon as reasonably possible after
the reference is made and give notice to each of the parties either directly or by
requiring counsel to file and serve a notice of hearing. If any party fails to appear,
the special magistrate may proceed ex parte or may adjourn the proceeding to a
future day, giving notice to the absent party of the adjournment. The special
magistrate shall proceed with reasonable diligence in every reference and with the
least delay practicable. Any party may apply to the court for an order to the special
magistrate to speed the proceedings and to make the report and to certify to the
court the reason for any delay. Unless otherwise ordered by the court, or agreed to
by all parties, all parties shall equally share the cost of the presence of a court
reporter at a special magistrate’s proceedings. If all parties waive the presence of a
court reporter, they must do so in writing. The special magistrate shall have
authority to examine the parties and all witnesses under oath upon all matters
contained in the reference and to require production of all books, papers, writings,
vouchers, and other documents applicable to it. The special magistrate shall admit
evidence by deposition or that is otherwise admissible in court. The special
magistrate may take all actions concerning evidence that can be taken by the court
and in the same manner. All parties accounting before a special magistrate shall
bring in their accounts in the form of accounts payable and receivable, and any
other parties who are not satisfied with the account may examine the accounting
121party orally or by interrogatories or deposition as the special magistrate directs. All
depositions and documents that have been taken or used previously in the action
may be used before the special magistrate.
(f) Special Magistrate’s Report. The special magistrate shall file a
report that includes findings of fact and conclusions of law, together with
recommendations. In the report made by the special magistrate no part of any
statement of facts, account, charge, deposition, examination, or answer used before
the special magistrate need be recited. The matters shall be identified to inform the
court what items were used. The report shall include the name and address of the
court reporter present, if any.
(g) Filing Report; Notice; Exceptions. The special magistrate shall file
the report and recommendations and serve copies on the parties. The parties may
file exceptions to the report within 10 days from the time it is served on them. If no
exceptions are filed within that period, the court shall take appropriate action on
the report. Any party may file cross-exceptions within 5 days from the filing of the
exceptions, provided, however, that the filing of cross-exceptions shall not delay
the hearing on the exceptions unless good cause is shown. If exceptions are filed,
they shall be heard on reasonable notice by either party. The party seeking to have
exceptions heard shall be responsible for the preparation of the transcript of
proceedings before the special magistrate.
(h) Expenses of Special Magistrate. The costs of a special magistrate
may be assessed as any other suit money in family proceedings and all or part of it
may be ordered prepaid by order of the court.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. Originally, both general and special masters were governed
under Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.490. General and special masters are now
governed under Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure 12.490 and 12.492,
respectively. The requirements for appointing special masters are essentially the
same as under the previous rule; but this rule eliminates the need for consent for
the court to appoint an attorney/special master to preside over depositions and rule
on objections. It also provides for the assessment of suit monies and allows for the
filing of cross-exceptions.
Committee Note
2004 Amendment. In accordance with Chapter 2004-11, Laws of Florida,
122all references to special master were changed to special magistrate.
RULE 12.500. DEFAULTS AND FINAL JUDGMENTS THEREON
(a) By the Clerk. When a party against whom affirmative relief is sought
has failed to file or serve any document in the action, the party seeking relief may
have the clerk enter a default against the party failing to serve or file such
document.
(b) By the Court. When a party against whom affirmative relief is sought
has failed to plead or otherwise respond as provided by these rules or any
applicable statute or any order of court, the court may enter a default against such
party provided that if such party has filed or served any document in the action,
that party must be served with notice of the application for default.
(c) Right to Plead. A party may plead or otherwise respond at any time
before default is entered. If a party in default files any document after the default is
entered, the clerk must notify the party of the entry of the default. The clerk must
make an entry on the docket showing the notification.
(d) Setting Aside Default. The court may set aside a default, and if a
final judgment on it has been entered, the court may set it aside in accordance with
rule 12.540(b).
(e) Final Judgment. Final judgments after default may be entered by the
court at any time, but no judgment may be entered against a minor or incapacitated
person unless represented in the action by a general guardian, guardian ad litem,
attorney ad litem, committee, conservator, or other representative who has
appeared in it or unless the court has made an order under rule 12.210(b) providing
that no representative is necessary for the minor or incapacitated person. If it is
necessary to take an account or to determine the amount of damages or to establish
the truth of any allegation by evidence or to make an investigation of any other
matter to enable the court to enter judgment or to effectuate it, the court may
receive affidavits, make referrals, or conduct hearings as it deems necessary and
must accord a right of trial by jury to the parties when required by the Constitution
or any statute.
RULE 12.510. SUMMARY JUDGMENT
(a) For Claimant. A party seeking to recover on a claim, counterpetition,
crossclaim, or third-party claim or to obtain a declaratory judgment may move for
123a summary judgment in that party’s favor on all or any part of it with or without
supporting affidavits at any time after the expiration of 20 days from the
commencement of the action or after service of a motion for summary judgment by
the adverse party.
(b) For Defending Party. A party against whom a claim, counterpetition,
crossclaim, or third-party claim is asserted or a declaratory judgment is sought may
move for a summary judgment in that party’s favor as to all or any part of it at any
time with or without supporting affidavits.
(c) Motion and Proceedings Thereon. The motion must state with
particularity the grounds on which it is based and the substantial matters of law to
be argued and must specifically identify any affidavits, answers to interrogatories,
admissions, depositions, and other materials as would be admissible in evidence
(“summary judgment evidence”) on which the movant relies. The movant must
serve the motion at least 20 days before the time fixed for the hearing, and must
also serve at that time any summary judgment evidence on which the movant relies
that has not already been filed with the court. The adverse party must identify, by
notice served under Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516 at least 5 days
prior to the day of the hearing, or delivered no later than 5:00 p.m. 2 business days
prior to the day of the hearing, any summary judgment evidence on which the
adverse party relies. To the extent that summary judgment evidence has not already
been filed with the court, the adverse party must serve a copy on the movant under
rule 2.516 at least 5 days prior to the day of the hearing, or by delivery to the
movant’s attorney no later than 5:00 p.m. 2 business days prior to the day of the
hearing. The judgment sought must be rendered immediately if the pleadings and
summary judgment evidence on file show that there is no genuine issue as to any
material fact and that the moving party is entitled to a judgment as a matter of law.
A summary judgment, interlocutory in character, may be rendered on the issue of
liability alone although there is a genuine issue as to the amount of damages.
(d) Case Not Fully Adjudicated on Motion. On motion under this rule if
judgment is not rendered on the whole case or for all the relief asked and a trial or
the taking of testimony and a final hearing is necessary, the court at the hearing of
the motion, by examining the pleadings and the evidence before it and by
interrogating counsel, must ascertain, if practicable, what material facts exist
without substantial controversy and what material facts are actually and in good
faith controverted. It must then make an order specifying the facts that appear
without substantial controversy, including the extent to which the amount of
damages or other relief is not in controversy, and directing such further
124proceedings in the action as are just. On the trial or final hearing of the action the
facts so specified shall be deemed established, and the trial or final hearing shall be
conducted accordingly.
(e) Form of Affidavits; Further Testimony. Supporting and opposing
affidavits must be made on personal knowledge, must set forth such facts as would
be admissible in evidence, and must show affirmatively that the affiant is
competent to testify to the matters stated therein. Sworn or certified copies of all
documents or parts thereof referred to in an affidavit must be attached to it or
served with it. The court may permit affidavits to be supplemented or opposed by
depositions, answers to interrogatories, or by further affidavits.
(f) When Affidavits Are Unavailable. If it appears from the affidavits
of a party opposing the motion that the party cannot for reasons stated present by
affidavit facts essential to justify opposition, the court may refuse the application
for judgment or may order a continuance to permit affidavits to be obtained or
depositions to be taken or discovery to be had or may make such other order as is
just.
(g) Affidavits Made in Bad Faith. If it appears to the satisfaction of the
court at any time that any of the affidavits presented under this rule are presented
in bad faith or solely for the purpose of delay, the court must immediately order the
party employing them to pay to the other party the amount of the reasonable
expenses which the filing of the affidavits caused the other party to incur,
including reasonable attorneys’ fees, and any offending party or attorney may be
adjudged guilty of contempt.
Committee Notes
2012 Amendment. This rule is amended to state who the adverse party
serves and provide for service in accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial
Administration 2.516.
RULE 12.520. VIEW
Upon motion of either party or on the court’s own motion, the trier of fact
may view the premises or place in question or any property, matter, or thing
relating to the controversy between the parties when it appears that view is
necessary to a just decision.
Commentary
1251995 Adoption. This rule replaces Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.520
and eliminates the advancement of costs imposed by rule 1.520.
RULE 12.530. MOTIONS FOR NEW TRIAL AND REHEARING;
AMENDMENTS OF JUDGMENTS
(a) Jury and Non-Jury Actions. A new trial or rehearing may be granted
to all or any of the parties and on all or a part of the issues. On a motion for a
rehearing of matters heard without a jury, including summary judgments, the court
may open the judgment if one has been entered, take additional testimony, and
enter a new judgment.
(b) Time for Motion. A motion for new trial or for rehearing must be
served not later than 15 days after the return of the verdict in a jury action or the
date of filing of the judgment in a non-jury action. A timely motion may be
amended to state new grounds in the discretion of the court at any time before the
motion is determined.
(c) Time for Serving Affidavits. When a motion for a new trial or
rehearing is based on affidavits, the affidavits must be served with the motion. The
opposing party has 10 days after such service within which to serve opposing
affidavits, which period may be extended for an additional period not exceeding 20
days either by the court for good cause shown or by the parties by written
stipulation. The court may permit reply affidavits.
(d) On Initiative of Court. Not later than 15 days after entry of judgment
or within the time of ruling on a timely motion for a rehearing or a new trial made
by a party, the court of its own initiative may order a rehearing or a new trial for
any reason for which it might have granted a rehearing or a new trial on motion of
a party.
(e) When Motion Is Unnecessary; Non-Jury Case. When an action has
been tried by the court without a jury, the sufficiency of the evidence to support the
judgment may be raised on appeal whether or not the party raising the question has
made any objection to it in the trial court or made a motion for rehearing, for new
trial, or to alter or amend the judgment.
(f) Hearing on Motion. When any motion for rehearing or new trial is
filed, the court must initially make a determination if a hearing on the motion is
required. If a hearing is required, the court must provide notice of the hearing on
the motion for rehearing or new trial. If the court determines that a hearing is not
126required, then the court must enter an order granting or denying the motion in
accordance with this rule.
(g) Order Granting to Specify Grounds. All orders granting a new trial
or rehearing must specify the specific grounds for it. If such an order is appealed
and does not state the specific grounds, the appellate court must relinquish its
jurisdiction to the trial court for entry of an order specifying the grounds for
granting the new trial or a rehearing.
(h) Motion to Alter or Amend a Judgment. A motion to alter or amend
the judgment must be served not later than 15 days after entry of the judgment,
except that this rule does not affect the remedies in rule 12.540(b).
RULE 12.540. RELIEF FROM JUDGMENT, DECREES, OR ORDERS
(a) Clerical Mistakes. Clerical mistakes in judgments or other parts of
the record and errors arising from oversight or omission may be corrected by the
court at any time on its own initiative or on the motion of any party and after such
notice, if any, as the court orders. During the pendency of an appeal such mistakes
may be so corrected before the record on appeal is docketed in the appellate court,
and thereafter while the appeal is pending may be so corrected with leave of the
appellate court.
(b) Mistakes; Inadvertence; Excusable Neglect; Newly Discovered
Evidence; Fraud; etc. On motion and on such terms as are just, the court may
relieve a party or a party’s legal representative from a final judgment, order, or
proceeding for the following reasons:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not
have been discovered in time to move for a new trial or rehearing;
(3) fraud (whether heretofore denominated intrinsic or extrinsic),
misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an adverse party;
(4) that the judgment is void; or
(5) that the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or
a prior judgment on which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it
is no longer equitable that the judgment should have prospective application.
127The motion must be filed within a reasonable time, and for reasons (1), (2),
and (3) not more than 1 year after the judgment, order, or proceeding was entered
or taken; except that there will be no time limit for motions based on fraudulent
financial affidavits in marital or paternity cases. The motion and any attachment or
exhibit to it must be in compliance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration
2.425. A motion under this subdivision does not affect the finality of a judgment or
suspend its operation. This rule does not limit the power of a court to entertain an
independent action or supplemental proceeding to relieve a party from a judgment,
order, or proceeding or to set aside a judgment for fraud on the court.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. Under this provision, Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.540
applies to all family law issues involving relief from judgment, decrees, or orders,
except that there shall be no time limit for motions filed under rule 1.540(b) based
on fraudulent financial affidavits in marital or paternity cases. Rule 1.540 was
expanded to include marital cases through the rule making procedure subsequent to
the Florida Supreme Court’s decision in DeClaire v. Yohanan, 453 So.2d 375 (Fla.
1984).
RULE 12.550. EXECUTIONS AND FINAL PROCESS
(a) Issuance. Executions on judgments shall issue during the life of the
judgment on the oral request of the party entitled to it or that party’s attorney. No
execution or other final process may issue until the judgment on which it is based
has been recorded nor within the time for serving a motion for new trial or
rehearing, and if a motion for new trial or rehearing is timely served, until it is
determined. Execution or other final process may be issued on special order of the
court at any time after judgment.
(b) Stay. The court before which an execution or other process based on a
final judgment is returnable may stay such execution or other process and suspend
proceedings on it for good cause on motion and notice to all adverse parties.
RULE 12.560. DISCOVERY IN AID OF EXECUTION
(a) In General. In aid of a judgment, decree, or execution the judgment
creditor or the successor in interest, when the interest appears of record, may
obtain discovery from any person, including the judgment debtor, in the manner
provided in these rules.
128(b) Fact Information Sheet. In addition to any other discovery available
to a judgment creditor under this rule, the court, at the request of the judgment
creditor, shall order the judgment debtor or debtors to complete Florida Rules of
Civil Procedure Form 1.977 (Fact Information Sheet), including all required
attachments, within 45 days of the order or such other reasonable time as
determined by the court.
(c) Final Judgment Enforcement Paragraph. In any final judgment
which awards money damages, the judge shall include the following enforcement
paragraph if requested at the final hearing or a subsequently noticed hearing by the
prevailing party or attorney:
“It is further ordered and adjudged that the judgment debtor(s) shall
complete under oath Florida Rule of Civil Procedure Form 1.977 (Fact
Information Sheet), including all required attachments, and serve it on the
judgment creditor’s attorney, or the judgment creditor if the judgment
creditor is not represented by an attorney, within 45 days from the date of
this final judgment, unless the final judgment is satisfied or post-judgment
discovery is stayed.
“Jurisdiction of this case is retained to enter further orders that are
proper to compel the judgment debtor(s) to complete form 1.977, including
all required attachments, and serve it on the judgment creditor’s attorney, or
the judgment creditor if the judgment creditor is not represented by an
attorney.”
(d) Information Regarding Assets of Judgment Debtor’s Spouse. In
any final judgment which awards money damages, if requested by the judgment
creditor at a duly noticed hearing, the court shall require all or part of the
additional Spouse Related Portion of the fact information sheet to be filled out by
the judgment debtor only upon a showing that a proper predicate exists for
discovery of separate income and assets of the judgment debtor’s spouse.
Committee Notes
2000 Amendment. Subdivisions (b)–(e) were added to the Florida Rules of
Civil Procedure and adopted with amendments into the Family Law Rules of
Procedure. The amendments to the Civil Rules were patterned after Florida Small
Claims Rule 7.221(a) and Form 7.343. Although the judgment creditor is entitled
to broad discovery into the judgment debtor’s finances (Fla. R. Civ. P. 1.280(b);
Jim Appley’s Tru-Arc, Inc. v. Liquid Extraction Systems, 526 So.2d 177, 179 (Fla.
1292d DCA 1988)), in family law cases inquiry into the individual assets of the
judgment debtor’s spouse must be precluded until a proper predicate has been
shown. Tru-Arc, Inc., 526 So.2d at 179; Rose Printing Co. v. D’Amato, 338 So.2d
212 (Fla. 3d DCA 1976).
2015 Amendment. Subdivision (e) was deleted because the filing of a
notice of compliance is unnecessary for the judgment creditor to seek relief from
the court for noncompliance with this rule and because the Fact Information Sheet
should not be filed with the clerk of the court.
RULE 12.570. ENFORCEMENT OF JUDGMENTS
(a) Money Judgments. Final process to enforce a judgment solely for the
payment of money shall be by execution, writ of garnishment, or other appropriate
process or proceedings. Money judgments shall include, but not be limited to,
judgments for alimony, child support, equitable distribution payments, attorneys’
fees, suit money, and costs.
(b) Property Recovery. Final process to enforce a judgment for the
recovery of property shall be by a writ of possession for real property and by a writ
of replevin, distress writ, writ of garnishment, or other appropriate process or
proceedings for other property.
(c) Performance of an Act. If judgment is for the performance of a
specific act or contract:
(1) the judgment must specify the time within which the act must
be performed. If the act is not performed within the time specified, the party
seeking enforcement of the judgment shall make an affidavit that the judgment has
not been complied with within the prescribed time and the clerk shall issue a writ
of attachment against the delinquent party. The delinquent party shall not be
released from the writ of attachment until that party has complied with the
judgment and paid all costs accruing because of the failure to perform the act. If
the delinquent party cannot be found, the party seeking enforcement of the
judgment shall file an affidavit to this effect and the court shall issue a writ of
sequestration against the delinquent party’s property. The writ of sequestration
shall not be dissolved until the delinquent party complies with the judgment;
(2) the court may hold the disobedient party in contempt; or
130(3) the court may appoint some person, not a party to the action, to
perform the act insofar as practicable. The performance of the act by the person
appointed has the same effect as if performed by the party against whom the
judgment was entered.
(d) Parental Responsibility. Actions for enforcement of issues related to
parental responsibility may be brought by motion.
(e) Vesting Title. If the judgment is for a conveyance, transfer, release, or
acquittance of real or personal property, the judgment has the effect of a duly
executed conveyance, transfer, release, or acquittance that is recorded in the county
where the judgment is recorded. A judgment under this subdivision will be
effective notwithstanding any disability of a party.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. Nothing in this rule or Florida Rule of Civil Procedure
1.570 should be read to preclude the use of other remedies to enforce judgments.
RULE 12.580. WRIT OF POSSESSION
(a) Issuance. When a judgment or order is for the delivery of possession
of real property, the judgment or order shall direct the clerk to issue a writ of
possession. The clerk must issue the writ immediately and deliver it to the sheriff
for execution.
(b) Third-Party Claims. If a person other than the party against whom
the writ of possession is issued is in possession of the property, that person may
retain possession of the property by filing with the sheriff an affidavit that the
person is entitled to possession of the property, specifying the nature of the claim.
The sheriff must then desist from enforcing the writ and must serve a copy of the
affidavit on the party causing issuance of the writ of possession. The party causing
issuance of the writ may apply to the court for an order directing the sheriff to
complete execution of the writ. The court will determine the right of possession in
the property and may order the sheriff to continue to execute the writ or may stay
execution of the writ, if appropriate.
131RULE 12.590. PROCESS IN BEHALF OF AND AGAINST PERSONS
NOT PARTIES
Every person who is not a party to the action who has obtained an order, or
in whose favor an order has been made, may enforce obedience to such order by
the same process as if that person were a party, and every person, not a party,
against whom obedience to any order may be enforced is liable to the same process
for enforcing obedience to such orders as if that person were a party.
RULE 12.600. DEPOSITS IN COURT
In an action in which any part of the relief sought is a judgment for a sum of
money or the disposition of a sum of money or the disposition of any other thing
capable of delivery, a party may deposit all or any part of such sum or thing with
the court on notice to every other party and by leave of court. Money paid into
court under this rule shall be deposited and withdrawn by order of court. The party
depositing money or depositing the thing capable of delivery shall pay any fee
imposed by the clerk of the court, unless the court orders otherwise.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. The addition to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure 1.600
included in this rule is intended to clarify responsibility for the payment of clerk’s
fees.
RULE 12.605. INJUNCTIONS
(a) Temporary Injunction.
(1) This rule does not apply to relief sought under rule 12.610.
(2) notice to the adverse party only if:
A temporary injunction may be granted without written or oral
(A) it appears from the specific facts shown by affidavit or
verified pleading that immediate and irreparable injury, loss, or damage will result
to the movant before the adverse party can be heard in opposition; and
(B) the movant or movant’s attorney certifies in writing any
efforts that have been made to give notice and the reasons why notice should not
be required.
132(3) No evidence other than the affidavit or verified pleading may be
used to support the application for a temporary injunction unless the adverse party
appears at the hearing or has received reasonable notice of the hearing. Every
temporary injunction granted without notice must be endorsed with the date and
hour of entry and must be filed immediately in the clerk’s office and must define
the injury, state findings by the court why the injury may be irreparable, and give
the reasons why the order was granted without notice if notice was not given. The
temporary injunction shall remain in effect until the further order of the court.
(b) Bond. No temporary injunction may be entered unless a bond is given
by the movant in an amount the court deems proper, conditioned for the payment
of costs and damages sustained by the adverse party if the adverse party is
wrongfully enjoined. When any injunction is issued on the pleading of a
municipality or the state or any officer, agency, or political subdivision of it, the
court may require or dispense with a bond, with or without surety, and conditioned
in the same manner, having due regard for the public interest. No bond shall be
required for issuance of a temporary injunction issued solely to prevent physical
injury or abuse of a natural person.
(c) Form and Scope. Every injunction must specify the reasons for entry,
must describe in reasonable detail the act or acts restrained without reference to a
pleading or another document, and must be binding on the parties to the action,
their officers, agents, servants, employees, and attorneys and on those persons in
active concert or participation with them who receive actual notice of the
injunction.
(d) Motion to Dissolve. A party against whom a temporary injunction has
been granted may move to dissolve or modify it at any time. If a party moves to
dissolve or modify, the motion must be heard within 5 days after the movant
applies for a hearing on the motion.
Committee Note
2017 Adoption. The case law related to Florida Rule of Civil Procedure
1.610 shall be applicable to this rule.
133RULE 12.610. INJUNCTIONS FOR PROTECTION AGAINST
DOMESTIC, REPEAT, DATING, AND SEXUAL
VIOLENCE, AND STALKING
(a) Application. This rule shall apply only to temporary and permanent
injunctions for protection against domestic violence and temporary and permanent
injunctions for protection against repeat violence, dating violence, or sexual
violence, and stalking. All other injunctive relief sought in cases to which the
Family Law Rules apply shall be governed by Florida Rule of Civil Procedure
1.610.
(b) Petitions.
(1) Requirements for Use.
(A) Domestic Violence. Any person may file a petition for
an injunction for protection against domestic violence as provided by law.
(B) Repeat Violence. Any person may file a petition for an
injunction for protection against repeat violence as provided by law.

injunction for protection against dating violence as provided by law.
(D) Sexual Violence. Any person may file a petition for an
injunction for protection against sexual violence as provided by law.
(E) Stalking. Any person may file a petition for an
injunction for protection against stalking as provided by law.
(2) Service of Petitions.
(A) Domestic Violence. Personal service by a law
enforcement agency is required. The clerk of the court shall furnish a copy of the
petition for an injunction for protection against domestic violence, financial
affidavit (if support is sought), Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and
Enforcement Act affidavit (if custody is sought), temporary injunction (if one has
been entered), and notice of hearing to the appropriate sheriff or law enforcement
agency of the county where the respondent resides or can be found for expeditious
service of process.
134(B) Repeat Violence, Dating Violence, Sexual Violence
and Stalking. Personal service by a law enforcement agency is required. The clerk
of the court shall furnish a copy of the petition for an injunction for protection
against repeat violence, dating violence, sexual violence, or stalking, temporary
injunction (if one has been entered), and notice of hearing to the appropriate sheriff
or law enforcement agency of the county where the respondent resides or can be
found for expeditious service of process.
(C) Additional Documents. Service of pleadings in cases of
domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking other than petitions,
supplemental petitions, and orders granting injunctions shall be governed by rule
12.080, except that service of a motion to modify or vacate an injunction should be
by notice that is reasonably calculated to apprise the nonmoving party of the
pendency of the proceedings.
(3) Consideration by Court.
(A) Domestic Violence and Stalking Injunctions. Upon the
filing of a petition, the court shall set a hearing to be held at the earliest possible
time. A denial of a petition for an ex parte injunction shall be by written order
noting the legal grounds for denial. When the only ground for denial is no
appearance of an immediate and present danger of domestic violence or stalking,
the court shall set a full hearing on the petition for injunction with notice at the
earliest possible time. Nothing herein affects a petitioner’s right to promptly amend
any petition, or otherwise be heard in person on any petition consistent with these
rules.
(B) Repeat, Dating, or Sexual Violence Injunctions. Upon
the filing of a petition, the court shall set a hearing to be held at the earliest
possible time. Nothing herein affects a petitioner’s right to promptly amend any
petition or otherwise be heard in person on any petition consistent with these rules.
(4) Forms.
(A) Provision of Forms. The clerk of the court or family or
injunctions for protection intake personnel shall provide simplified forms,
including instructions for completion, for any person whose circumstances meet
the requirements of this rule and shall assist the petitioner in obtaining an
injunction for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or
stalking as provided by law.
135(B) Confidential Filing of Address. A petitioner’s address
may be furnished to the court in a confidential filing separate from a petition or
other form if, for safety reasons, a petitioner believes that the address should be
concealed. The ultimate determination of a need for confidentiality must be made
by the court as provided in Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.420.
(c) Orders of Injunction.
(1) Consideration by Court.
(A) Temporary Injunction.
(i) Domestic, Repeat, Dating, or Sexual Violence.
For the injunction for protection to be issued ex parte, it must appear to the court
that an immediate and present danger of domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual
violence exists. In an ex parte hearing for the purpose of obtaining an ex parte
temporary injunction, the court may limit the evidence to the verified pleadings or
affidavits for a determination of whether there is an imminent danger that the
petitioner will become a victim of domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence. If
the respondent appears at the hearing or has received reasonable notice of the
hearing, the court may hold a hearing on the petition. If a verified petition and
affidavit are amended, the court shall consider the amendments as if originally
filed.
(ii) Stalking. For the injunction for protection to be
issued ex parte, it must appear to the court that stalking exists. In an ex parte
hearing for the purpose of obtaining an ex parte temporary injunction, the court
may limit the evidence to the verified pleadings or affidavits for a determination of
whether stalking exists. If the respondent appears at the hearing or has received
reasonable notice of the hearing, the court may hold the hearing on the petition. If a
verified petition and affidavit are amended, the court shall consider the
amendments as if originally filed.
(B) Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against
Repeat, Dating, or Sexual Violence or Stalking. A hearing shall be conducted.
(C) Final Judgment of Injunction for Protection Against
Domestic Violence. The court shall conduct a hearing and make a finding of
whether domestic violence occurred or whether imminent danger of domestic
violence exists. If the court determines that an injunction will be issued, the court
shall also rule on the following:
136(i) whether the respondent may have any contact with
the petitioner, and if so, under what conditions;
(ii) exclusive use of the parties’ shared residence;
(iii) petitioner’s temporary time-sharing with the minor
child or children;
(iv) whether respondent will have temporary time-
sharing with the minor child or children and whether it will be supervised;
(v) whether temporary child support will be ordered;
(vi) whether temporary spousal support will be
ordered; and
(vii) such other relief as the court deems necessary for
the protection of the petitioner.
The court, with the consent of the parties, may refer the parties to mediation by a
certified family mediator to attempt to resolve the details as to the above rulings.
This mediation shall be the only alternative dispute resolution process offered by
the court. Any agreement reached by the parties through mediation shall be
reviewed by the court and, if approved, incorporated into the final judgment. If no
agreement is reached the matters referred shall be returned to the court for
appropriate rulings. Regardless of whether all issues are resolved in mediation, an
injunction for protection against domestic violence shall be entered or extended the
same day as the hearing on the petition commences.
(2) Issuing of Injunction.
(A) Standarized Forms. The temporary and permanent
injunction forms approved by the Florida Supreme Court for domestic, repeat,
dating, and sexual violence, and stalking injunctions shall be the forms used in the
issuance of injunctions under chapters 741 and 784, Florida Statutes. Additional
standard provisions, not inconsistent with the standarized portions of those forms,
may be added to the special provisions section of the temporary and permanent
injunction forms, or at the end of each section to which they apply, on the written
approval of the chief judge of the circuit, and upon final review and written
approval by the chief justice. Copies of such additional standard provisions, once
approved by the chief justice, shall be sent to the chair of the Family Law Rules
137Committee of The Florida Bar, the chair of the Steering Committee on Families
and Children in the Court, and the chair of The Governor’s Task Force on
Domestic and Sexual Violence.
(B) Bond. No bond shall be required by the court for the
entry of an injunction for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual
violence, or stalking. The clerk of the court shall provide the parties with sufficient
certified copies of the order of injunction for service.
(3) Service of Injunctions.
(A) Temporary Injunction. A temporary injunction for
protection against domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking must be
personally served. When the respondent has been served previously with the
temporary injunction and has failed to appear at the initial hearing on the
temporary injunction, any subsequent pleadings seeking an extension of time may
be served on the respondent by the clerk of the court by certified mail in lieu of
personal service by a law enforcement officer. If the temporary injunction was
issued after a hearing because the respondent was present at the hearing or had
reasonable notice of the hearing, the injunction may be served in the manner
provided for a permanent injunction.
(B) Permanent Injunction.
(i) Party Present at Hearing. The parties may
acknowledge receipt of the permanent injunction for protection against domestic,
repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking in writing on the face of the original
order. If a party is present at the hearing and that party fails or refuses to
acknowledge the receipt of a certified copy of the injunction, the clerk shall cause
the order to be served by mailing certified copies of the injunction to the parties
who were present at the hearing at the last known address of each party. Service by
mail is complete upon mailing. When an order is served pursuant to this
subdivision, the clerk shall prepare a written certification to be placed in the court
file specifying the time, date, and method of service and within 24 hours shall
forward a copy of the injunction and the clerk’s affidavit of service to the sheriff
with jurisdiction over the residence of the petitioner. This procedure applies to
service of orders to modify or vacate injunctions for protection against domestic,
repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking.
(ii) Party not Present at Hearing. Within 24 hours
after the court issues, continues, modifies, or vacates an injunction for protection
138against domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or stalking the clerk shall
forward a copy of the injunction to the sheriff with jurisdiction over the residence
of the petitioner for service.
(4) Duration.
(A) Temporary Injunction. Any temporary injunction shall
be effective for a fixed period not to exceed 15 days. A full hearing shall be set for
a date no later than the date when the temporary injunction ceases to be effective.
The court may grant a continuance of the temporary injunction and of the full
hearing for good cause shown by any party, or upon its own motion for good
cause, including failure to obtain service.
(B) Permanent Injunction. Any relief granted by an
injunction for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or
stalking shall be granted for a fixed period or until further order of court. Such
relief may be granted in addition to other civil and criminal remedies. Upon
petition of the victim, the court may extend the injunction for successive periods or
until further order of court. Broad discretion resides with the court to grant an
extension after considering the circumstances. No specific allegations are required.
(5) Enforcement. The court may enforce violations of an
injunction for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual violence, or
stalking in civil contempt proceedings, which are governed by rule 12.570, or in
criminal contempt proceedings, which are governed by Florida Rule of Criminal
Procedure 3.840, or, if the violation meets the statutory criteria, it may be
prosecuted as a crime under Florida Statutes.
(6) Motion to Modify or Vacate Injunction. The petitioner or
respondent may move the court to modify or vacate an injunction at any time.
Service of a motion to modify or vacate injunctions shall be governed by
subdivision (b)(2) of this rule. However, for service of a motion to modify to be
sufficient if a party is not represented by an attorney, service must be in accordance
with rule 12.070, or in the alternative, there must be filed in the record proof of
receipt of this motion by the nonmoving party personally.
(7) Forms. The clerk of the court or family or injunction for
protection intake personnel shall provide simplified forms including instructions
for completion, for the persons whose circumstances meet the requirements of this
rule and shall assist in the preparation of the affidavit in support of the violation of
139an order of injunction for protection against domestic, repeat, dating, or sexual
violence, or stalking.
Commentary
2003 Amendment. This rule was amended to emphasize the importance of
judicial involvement in resolving injunction for protection against domestic
violence cases and to establish protections if mediation is used. In performing case
management, court staff may interview the parties separately to identify and clarify
their positions. Court staff may present this information to the court along with a
proposed order for the court’s consideration in the hearing required by subdivision
(b). The first sentence of (c)(1)(C) contemplates that an injunction will not be
entered unless there is a finding that domestic violence occurred or that there is
imminent danger of domestic violence. Subdivision (c)(1)(C) also enumerates
certain rulings that a judge must make after deciding to issue an injunction and
before referring parties to mediation. This is intended to ensure that issues
involving safety are decided by the judge and not left to the parties to resolve. The
list is not meant to be exhaustive, as indicated by subdivision (c)(1)(C)(vii), which
provides for “other relief,” such as retrieval of personal property and referrals to
batterers’ intervention programs. The prohibition against use of any “alternative
dispute resolution” other than mediation is intended to preclude any court-based
process that encourages or facilitates, through mediation or negotiation, agreement
as to one or more issues, but does not preclude the parties through their attorneys
from presenting agreements to the court. All agreements must be consistent with
this rule regarding findings. Prior to ordering the parties to mediate, the court
should consider risk factors in the case and the suitability of the case for mediation.
The court should not refer the case to mediation if there has been a high degree of
past violence, a potential for future lethality exists, or there are other factors which
would compromise the mediation process.
1995 Adoption. A cause of action for an injunction for protection against
domestic violence and repeat violence has been created by section 741.30, Florida
Statutes (Supp.1994) (modified by chapter 95 195, Laws of Florida), and section
784.046, Florida Statutes (Supp. 1994), respectively. This rule implements those
provisions and is intended to be consistent with the procedures set out in those
provisions except as indicated in this commentary. To the extent a domestic or
repeat violence matter becomes criminal or is to be enforced by direct or indirect
criminal contempt, the appropriate Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure will apply.
The facts and circumstances to be alleged under subdivision 12.610(b)(1)(A)
include those set forth in Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form
14012.980(b). An injunction for protection against domestic or repeat violence may be
sought whether or not any other cause of action is currently pending between the
parties. However, the pendency of any such cause of action must be alleged in the
petition. The relief the court may grant in a temporary or permanent injunction
against domestic violence is set forth in sections 741.30(5)–(6).
The facts and circumstances to be alleged under subdivision (b)(1)(B)
include those set forth in Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form
12.980(g). The relief the court may grant in a temporary or permanent injunction
against repeat violence is set forth in section 784.046(7), Florida Statutes.
Subdivision (b)(4) expands sections 741.30(2)(c)1 and (2)(c)2, Florida
Statutes, to provide that the responsibility to assist the petitioner may be assigned
not only to the clerk of court but also to the appropriate intake unit of the court.
Florida Supreme Court Approved Family Law Form 12.980(b) provides the form
for a petition for injunction against domestic violence. If the custody of a child is at
issue, a Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act affidavit must
be provided and completed in conformity with Florida Supreme Court Approved
Family Law Form 12.902(d). If alimony or child support is sought a Financial
Affidavit must be provided and completed in conformity with Florida Family Law
Rules of Procedure Form 12.902(b) or 12.902(c).
Subdivision (c)(1)(A) expands chapter 95 195, Laws of Florida, and section
784.046(6)(b), Florida Statutes, to make the limitation of evidence presented at an
ex parte hearing permissive rather than mandatory given the due process concerns
raised by the statutory restrictions on the taking of evidence.
Unlike traditional injunctions, under subdivision (c)(2), no bond will be
required for the issuance of injunctions for protection against domestic or repeat
violence. This provision is consistent with the statutes except that, unlike the
statutes, it does not set a precise number of copies to be provided for service.
Subdivision (c)(3)(A) makes the procedure for service of a temporary order
of injunction for protection against domestic violence and repeat violence
consistent. This is intended to replace the differing requirements contained in
sections 741.30(8)(a)1 and (8)(c)1 and 784.046(8)(a)1, Florida Statutes.
Subdivision (c)(3)(B) makes the procedure for service of a permanent order
of injunction for protection against domestic violence and repeat violence
consistent. This is intended to replace the differing requirements contained in
sections 741.30(8)(a)3 and (8)(c)1 and 784.046(8)(c)1, Florida Statutes, and to
specifically clarify that service of the permanent injunction by mail is only
141effective upon a party who is present at the hearing which resulted in the issuance
of the injunction.
Subdivision (c)(4)(A) restates sections 741.30(5)(c) and 784.046(6)(c),
Florida Statutes, with some expansion. This subdivision allows the court upon its
own motion to extend the protection of the temporary injunction for protection
against domestic or repeat violence for good cause shown, which shall include, but
not be limited to, failure to obtain service. This subdivision also makes the
procedures in cases of domestic and repeat violence identical, resolving the
inconsistencies in the statutes.
Subdivision (c)(4)(B) makes the procedures in cases of domestic and repeat
violence identical, resolving inconsistencies in the statutes. As stated in section
741.30(1)(c), Florida Statutes, in the event a subsequent cause of action is filed
under chapter 61, Florida Statutes, any orders entered therein shall take precedence
over any inconsistent provisions of an injunction for protection against domestic
violence which addresses matters governed by chapter 61, Florida Statutes.
Subdivision (c)(5) implements a number of statutes governing enforcement
of injunctions against domestic or repeat violence. It is intended by these rules that
procedures in cases of domestic and repeat violence be identical to resolve
inconsistencies in the statutes. As such, the procedures set out in section 741.31(1),
Florida Statutes, are to be followed for violations of injunctions for protection of
both domestic and repeat violence. Pursuant to that statute, the petitioner may
contact the clerk of the circuit court of the county in which the violation is alleged
to have occurred to obtain information regarding enforcement.
Subdivision (c)(7) expands sections 741.30(2)(c)1 and (2)(c)2, Florida
Statutes, to provide that the responsibility to assist a petitioner may not only be
assigned to the clerk of court but also to the appropriate intake unit of the court.
This subdivision makes the procedures in cases of domestic and cases of repeat
violence identical to resolve inconsistencies in the statutes.
Committee Note
1997 Amendment. This change mandates use of the injunction forms
provided with these rules to give law enforcement a standardized form to assist in
enforcement of injunctions. In order to address local concerns, circuits may add
special provisions not inconsistent with the mandatory portions.
142RULE 12.611. CENTRAL GOVERNMENTAL DEPOSITORY
(a) Administrative Order. If the chief judge of the circuit by
administrative order authorizes the creation of a central governmental depository
for the circuit or county within the circuit to receive, record, and disburse all
support alimony or maintenance payments, as provided in section 61.181, Florida
Statutes (1983), the court may direct that payment be made to the officer
designated in the administrative order.
(b) Payments to Public Officer.
(1) If the court so directs, the payments shall be made to the officer
designated.
(2) The officer shall keep complete and accurate accounts of all
payments received. Payments shall be made by cash, money order, cashier’s check,
or certified check. The officer shall promptly disburse the proceeds to the party
entitled to receive them under the judgment or order.
(3) Payment may be enforced by the party entitled to it or the court
may establish a system under which the officer issues a motion for enforcement
and a notice of hearing in the form approved by the supreme court. The motion and
notice shall be served on the defaulting party in accordance with Florida Rule of
Judicial Administration 2.516. At the hearing the court shall enter an appropriate
order based on the testimony presented to it.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule is a remnant of Florida Rule of Civil Procedure
1.611, which contained several unrelated issues. Those issues are now governed by
separate rules for automatic disclosure, simplified dissolution procedure, and this
rule for central governmental depository.
2012 Amendment. Subdivision (b)(3) is amended to provide for service in
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
RULE 12.615. CIVIL CONTEMPT IN SUPPORT MATTERS
(a) Applicability. This rule governs civil contempt proceedings in
support matters related to family law cases. The use of civil contempt sanctions
under this rule shall be limited to those used to compel compliance with a court
order or to compensate a movant for losses sustained as a result of a contemnor’s
143willful failure to comply with a court order. Contempt sanctions intended to punish
an offender or to vindicate the authority of the court are criminal in nature and are
governed by Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.830 and 3.840.
(b) Motion and Notice. Civil contempt may be initiated by motion. The
motion must recite the essential facts constituting the acts alleged to be
contemptuous. No civil contempt may be imposed without notice to the alleged
contemnor and without providing the alleged contemnor with an opportunity to be
heard. The civil contempt motion and notice of hearing may be served in
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516 provided notice is
reasonably calculated to apprise the alleged contemnor of the pendency of the
proceedings. The notice must specify the time and place of the hearing and must
contain the following language: “FAILURE TO APPEAR AT THE HEARING
MAY RESULT IN THE COURT ISSUING A WRIT OF BODILY
ATTACHMENT FOR YOUR ARREST. IF YOU ARE ARRESTED, YOU MAY
BE HELD IN JAIL UP TO 48 HOURS BEFORE A HEARING IS HELD.” This
notice must also state whether electronic recording or a court reporter is provided
by the court or whether a court reporter, if desired, must be provided by the party.
(c) Hearing. In any civil contempt hearing, after the court makes an
express finding that the alleged contemnor had notice of the motion and hearing:
(1) the court shall determine whether the movant has established
that a prior order directing payment of support was entered and that the alleged
contemnor has failed to pay all or part of the support set forth in the prior order;
and
(2) if the court finds the movant has established all of the
requirements in subdivision (c)(1) of this rule, the court shall,
(A) if the alleged contemnor is present, determine whether
the alleged contemnor had the present ability to pay support and willfully failed to
pay such support.
(B) if the alleged contemnor fails to appear, set a reasonable
purge amount based on the individual circumstances of the parties. The court may
issue a writ of bodily attachment and direct that, upon execution of the writ of
bodily attachment, the alleged contemnor be brought before the court within 48
hours for a hearing on whether the alleged contemnor has the present ability to pay
support and, if so, whether the failure to pay such support is willful.
144(d) Order and Sanctions. After hearing the testimony and evidence
presented, the court shall enter a written order granting or denying the motion for
contempt.
(1) An order finding the alleged contemnor to be in contempt shall
contain a finding that a prior order of support was entered, that the alleged
contemnor has failed to pay part or all of the support ordered, that the alleged
contemnor had the present ability to pay support, and that the alleged contemnor
willfully failed to comply with the prior court order. The order shall contain a
recital of the facts on which these findings are based.
(2) If the court grants the motion for contempt, the court may
impose appropriate sanctions to obtain compliance with the order including
incarceration, attorneys’ fees, suit money and costs, compensatory or coercive
fines, and any other coercive sanction or relief permitted by law provided the order
includes a purge provision as set forth in subdivision (e) of this rule.
(e) Purge. If the court orders incarceration, a coercive fine, or any other
coercive sanction for failure to comply with a prior support order, the court shall
set conditions for purge of the contempt, based on the contemnor’s present ability
to comply. The court shall include in its order a separate affirmative finding that
the contemnor has the present ability to comply with the purge and the factual
basis for that finding. The court may grant the contemnor a reasonable time to
comply with the purge conditions. If the court orders incarceration but defers
incarceration for more than 48 hours to allow the contemnor a reasonable time to
comply with the purge conditions, and the contemnor fails to comply within the
time provided, the movant shall file an affidavit of noncompliance with the court.
If payment is being made through the Central Governmental Depository, a
certificate from the depository shall be attached to the affidavit. The court then
may issue a writ of bodily attachment. Upon incarceration, the contemnor must be
brought before the court within 48 hours for a determination of whether the
contemnor continues to have the present ability to pay the purge.
(f) Review after Incarceration. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
rule, at any time after a contemnor is incarcerated, the court on its own motion or
motion of any party may review the contemnor’s present ability to comply with the
purge condition and the duration of incarceration and modify any prior orders.
(g) Other Relief. Where there is a failure to pay support or to pay support
on a timely basis but the failure is not willful, nothing in this rule shall be
145construed as precluding the court from granting such relief as may be appropriate
under the circumstances.
Commentary
1998 Adoption. This rule is limited to civil contempt proceedings. Should a
court wish to impose sanctions for criminal contempt, the court must refer to
Florida Rules of Criminal Procedure 3.830 and 3.840 and must provide the alleged
contemnor with all of the constitutional due process protections afforded to
criminal defendants. This rule is created to assist the trial courts in ensuring that
the due process rights of alleged contemnors are protected. A court that adjudges
an individual to be in civil contempt must always afford the contemnor the
opportunity to purge the contempt.
Committee Notes
2012 Amendment. This rule is amended to provide for service in
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
RULE 12.620. RECEIVERS
(a) Notice. The notice provisions of rule 12.605 apply to applications for
the appointment of receivers.
(b) Report. Every receiver must file in the clerk’s office a true and
complete inventory under oath of the property coming under the receiver’s control
or possession under the receiver’s appointment within 20 days after appointment.
Every 3 months unless the court otherwise orders, the receiver must file in the
same office an inventory and account under oath of any additional property or
effects which the receiver has discovered or which may have come to the
receiver’s hands since appointment, and of the amount remaining in the hands of or
invested by the receiver, and of the manner in which the same is secured or
invested, stating the balance due from or to the receiver at the time of rendering the
last account and the receipts and expenditures since that time. When a receiver
neglects to file the inventory and account, the court must enter an order requiring
the receiver to file such inventory and account and to pay out of the receiver’s own
funds the expenses of the order and the proceedings on it within not more than 20
days after being served with a copy of such order.
146(c) Bond. The court may grant leave to put the bond of the receiver in
suit against the sureties without notice to the sureties of the application for such
leave.
(d) Contents of Inventory. Any inventory filed with the court must be in
compliance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.425.
RULE 12.625. PROCEEDINGS AGAINST SURETY ON JUDICIAL
BONDS
When any rule or statute requires or permits giving of bond by a party in a
judicial proceeding, the surety on the bond submits to the jurisdiction of the court
when the bond is approved. The surety must furnish the address for the service of
documents affecting the surety’s liability on the bond to the officer to whom the
bond is given at that time. The liability of the surety may be enforced on motion
without the necessity of an independent action. The motion must be served on the
surety at the address furnished to the officer. The surety must serve a response to
the motion within 20 days after service of the motion, asserting any defenses in law
or in fact. If the surety fails to serve a response within the time allowed, a default
may be taken. If the surety serves a response, the issues raised must be decided by
the court on reasonable notice to the parties. The right to jury trial may not be
abridged in any such proceedings.
RULE 12.630. EXTRAORDINARY REMEDIES
(a) Applicability. This rule applies to actions for the issuance of writs of
mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and habeas corpus.
(b) Initial Pleading. The initial pleading must be a petition. It must
contain:
(1) (2) (3) the facts on which the petitioner relies for relief;
a request for the relief sought; and
if desired, argument in support of the petition with citations of
authority.
The caption must show the action filed in the name of the petitioner in all
cases and not on the relation of the state. When the petition seeks a writ directed to
147a lower court or to a governmental or administrative agency, a copy of as much of
the record as is necessary to support the petitioner’s petition must be attached.
(c) (d) may issue:
Time. A petition must be filed within the time provided by law.
Process. If the petition shows a prima facie case for relief, the court
(1) an order nisi in prohibition;
(2) petition by reference only;
an alternative writ in mandamus that may incorporate the
(3) a writ of quo warranto; or
(4) a writ of habeas corpus.
The writ must be served in the manner prescribed by law.
(e) Response. Respondent must respond to the writ as provided in rule
12.140, but the answer in quo warranto must show better title to the office when
the writ seeks an adjudication of the right to an office held by the respondent.
Committee Note
2012 Amendment. This rule is amended to provide for service in
accordance with Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.516.
RULE 12.650. OVERRIDE OF FAMILY VIOLENCE INDICATOR
(a) Application. This rule shall apply only to proceedings instituted
pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 653, which authorizes a state court to override a family
violence indicator and release information from the Federal Parent Locator Service
notwithstanding the family violence indicator.
(b) Definitions.
(1) “Authorized person” means a person as defined in 42 U.S.C. §
653(c) and § 663(d)(2). It includes any agent or attorney of the Title IV-D agency
of this or any other state, the court that has authority to issue an order or to serve as
the initiating court in an action to seek an order against a parent or other person
obligated to pay child support, or any agent of such court, the parent or other
148person entitled to receive child support, legal guardian, attorney, or agent of a child
(other than a child receiving assistance under 42 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq.), and any
state agency that administers a child welfare, family preservation, or foster care
program. It also includes any agent or attorney of this or any other state who has
the duty or authority under the law of such state to enforce a child custody or
visitation determination or order establishing a parenting plan; the court that has
jurisdiction to make or enforce such a child custody or visitation determination or
order establishing a parenting plan, or any agent of such court; and any agent or
attorney of the United States, or of a state, who has the duty or authority to

(2) “Authorized purpose” means a purpose as defined in 42 U.S.C.
§ 653(a)(2) and § 663(b). It includes establishing parentage, establishing, setting
the amount of, modifying, or enforcing child support obligations, or making or
enforcing child custody or visitation orders or orders establishing parenting plans.
It also includes enforcing any state or federal law with respect to the unlawful

“Federal Parent Locator Service” means the information service
(6) “Petitioner” means an authorized person or an individual on
whose behalf an authorized person has requested a Federal Parent Locator Service
search and who has been notified that the information from the Federal Parent
Locator Service cannot be released because of a family violence indicator.
(7) “Respondent” means the individual whose record at the Federal
Parent Locator Service includes a family violence indicator and ordinarily does not
want his or her location information disclosed. The department, the Florida
Department of Law Enforcement, or the state entity that placed the family violence
indicator on the record may be required to respond to an order to show cause;
however, they are not considered respondents in these proceedings.
149(c) Initiating Proceedings. When an authorized person has attempted to
obtain information from the Federal Parent Locator Service and has been notified
by the Federal Parent Locator Service that it has location information but cannot
disclose the information because a family violence indicator has been placed on the
record, a petitioner may institute an action to override the family violence
indicator. An action is instituted by filing a sworn complaint in the circuit court.
The complaint must:
(1) allege that the petitioner is an authorized person or an
authorized person has requested information on his or her behalf from the Federal
Parent Locator Service and must include the factual basis for the allegation;
(2) allege that the petitioner is requesting the information for an
authorized purpose and state the purpose for which the information is sought;
(3) include the social security number, sex, race, current address,
and date of birth of the petitioner and any alias or prior name used by the

(7) include notice from the Federal Parent Locator Service that
location information on the respondent cannot be released because of a family
violence indicator.
(d) Initial Court Review. When a complaint is filed, the court shall
review the complaint ex parte for legal sufficiency to determine that it is from an
authorized person or an individual on whose behalf an authorized person requested
information from the Federal Parent Locator Service, is for an authorized purpose,
and includes the information required in subdivision (c). If the complaint is legally
sufficient, the court shall order the department to request the information from the
Federal Parent Locator Service and order the department to keep any information
150received from the Federal Parent Locator Service in its original sealed envelope
and provide it to the court within 45 days in the manner described in subdivision
(e) Receipt of Information. When sealed information from the Federal
Parent Locator Service is obtained, the department shall file the information with
the court. The information from the Federal Parent Locator Service shall remain in
its original sealed envelope and the outside of the envelope shall be clearly labeled
with the case number and the words “sealed information from Federal Parent
Locator Service.” The clerk of the court shall ensure that the sealed information
from the Federal Parent Locator Service is not disclosed to any person other than
those specifically authorized by the court. Court files in these proceedings shall be
separately secured in the Clerk’s office in accordance with the requirements of
subdivision (i).
(f) Review of Information by the Court. The court shall conduct an in-
camera examination of the contents of the sealed envelope from the Federal Parent
Locator Service.
(1) If the information from the sealed envelope does not include an
address for the respondent or an address for the respondent’s employer, the
petitioner and the department will be notified that no information is available and
no further action will be taken. The name of the state that placed the family
violence indicator on the record will not be released.
(2) If the information from the sealed envelope includes an address
for the respondent or the respondent’s employer, the court shall issue an order to
show cause to the respondent, the department, the Florida Department of Law
Enforcement (FDLE), and the state entity that placed the family violence indicator
on the record. The order to show cause shall
(A) give the respondent at least 45 days to show cause why
the location information should not be released to the petitioner;
(B) clearly state that the failure to respond may result in
disclosure of the respondent’s location information;
(C) direct the parties to file with the court all documentary
evidence which supports their respective positions, including any prior court
orders;
151(D) direct the department to search its child support
enforcement statewide automated system and case file for the presence of a Florida
family violence indicator, for any other information in that system or file that is
relevant to the issue of whether release of the respondent’s location information to
the petitioner could be harmful to the respondent or the child, and whether an
application for good cause under section 414.32, Florida Statutes, is pending or has
been granted and if so, file documentation with the court within 30 days;
(E) unless the FDLE is the petitioner, direct the FDLE to
conduct a search of its Florida criminal history records on the petitioner, including
information from the Domestic and Repeat Violence Injunction Statewide
Verification system, and file it with the court within 30 days; and
(F) set a hearing date within 60 days.
(3) The order to show cause shall be served as follows:
(A) By regular mail and by certified mail, return receipt
requested, to the respondent. If a receipt is not returned or a responsive pleading is
not filed, the court may extend the time for response and provide for personal
service on the respondent. The petitioner also may request that the respondent be
initially served by personal service, and if so, the petitioner shall pay into the
registry of the court the cost of effecting personal service.
(B) By certified mail, return receipt requested, to the
department, the FDLE, and the state entity that placed the family violence indicator
on the record.
(C) A copy of the order to show cause shall be provided to
the petitioner. However, the copy shall not include any information that may
identify the respondent’s location, including but not limited to the name or address
of the state entity that placed the family violence indicator on the record.
(g) Providing Information to Court.
(1) Information from Department. The department shall submit
the information it obtains in response to the order to show cause by filing the
information with the court in a sealed envelope. The outside of the envelope shall
be clearly labeled with the case number and the words “sealed information from
the Department of Revenue.” Any information that may reveal the location of the
152respondent should be distinctly noted so that this information is not inadvertently
disclosed.
(2) Information from FDLE. When it has searched its records in
response to the order to show cause, the FDLE shall file a report with the court.
The report shall include the case number and results of the search of its records.
(h) Hearing on Order to Show Cause.
(1) At the hearing on the order to show cause, the court shall
determine whether release of the respondent’s location information to the
petitioner could be harmful to the parent or the child. The petitioner has the burden
of proof to show that release of information to the petitioner would not be harmful
to the parent or the child.
(A) If the court finds that release of the location information
could be harmful, the information shall not be released and the petition shall be
denied.
(B) If the court finds that release of the location information
would not be harmful, the court shall disclose the location information to the
petitioner. The disclosure of the location information shall be made only to the
petitioner, and the court shall require that the petitioner not disclose the
information to other persons. The disclosure of location information to the
petitioner in these proceedings does not entitle the petitioner to future disclosure of
the respondent’s location information.
(C) The court may deny the request for location information
if the respondent agrees to designate a third party for service of process for
proceedings between the parties.
(2) Notwithstanding the provisions of Florida Rule of Judicial
Administration 2.530, the court may conduct a hearing on the order to show cause
by means of communications equipment without consent of the parties and without
a limitation on the time of the hearing. The communications equipment shall be
configured to ensure that the location of the respondent is not disclosed.
(i) Confidentiality. The clerk of the court shall ensure that all court
records in these proceedings are protected according to the requirements of this
rule. Court records in these proceedings shall be segregated and secured so that
information is not disclosed inadvertently from the court file. All court records in
153these proceedings are confidential and are not available for public inspection until
the court issues a final judgment in the case. After the court issues a final judgment
in the case, the location information from the Federal Parent Locator Service and
any other information that may lead to disclosure of the respondent’s location,
including but not limited to the respondent’s address, employment information, the
name or address of the state that placed the family violence indicator on the record,
and the telephone number of the respondent, shall remain confidential and not
available for public inspection unless otherwise ordered by the court. After the
court issues a final judgment in the case, the court shall release nonconfidential
information upon motion.
Commentary
This rule implements the requirements of 42 U.S.C. § 653, providing for a
state court to override a family violence indicator on a record at the Federal Parent
Locator Service. It does not apply to any other proceeding involving family
violence or any other court records. The limitations on access to the Federal Parent
Locator Service and this override process are governed by federal law.
Proceedings under this rule would arise when an authorized person has
attempted to obtain information from the Federal Parent Locator Service but has
been notified that the information cannot be released because of a family violence
indicator. For example, a petitioner may be a noncustodial parent who has
attempted to serve the custodial parent in an action to enforce visitation but was
unable to effect service of process on the custodial parent. The court may have
authorized access to the Federal Parent Locator Service in order to locate the
custodial parent for purposes of service of process. If the report from the Federal
Parent Locator Service indicates that the information cannot be released because of
a family violence indicator, the noncustodial parent would be authorized to petition
the court pursuant to this rule to override the family violence indicator.
The purpose of these proceedings is to determine whether to release location
information from the Federal Parent Locator Service notwithstanding the family
violence indicator. The court must determine whether release of the location
information to the petitioner would be harmful to the respondent. If the court
determines that release of the location information would not be harmful, the
information may be released to the petitioner. If the respondent agrees to designate
a third party for service of process, the court may deny the request for location
information. In these circumstances, the designation of a third party for service of
process is procedural only and does not provide a separate basis for jurisdiction
over the respondent.
154The court must use care to ensure that information from the Federal Parent
Locator Service or other location information in the court record is not
inadvertently released to the petitioner, thus defeating any interest of the
respondent in maintaining nondisclosure.
The name of the state that placed the family violence indicator on the record
may assist the petitioner in obtaining access to the respondent. If the name of the
state that placed the family violence indicator on the record is supplied from the
Federal Parent Locator Service, but an address for the respondent is not provided,
the court should not release the name of the state to the petitioner. Disclosure of
this information could assist the petitioner in locating the respondent, may place
the respondent in danger, and does not give the respondent an opportunity to be
heard by the court prior to release of the information.
Because the interest of the respondent is to keep location information from
the petitioner, having both the petitioner and respondent appear at a hearing at the
same time may also result in the petitioner obtaining location information about the
respondent. If a hearing must be held where both the petitioner and respondent are
present, the court should use whatever security measures are available to prevent
inadvertent disclosure of the respondent’s location information.
Each state establishes its own criteria, consistent with federal law, for
placing a family violence indicator on a record. Some states require a judicial
determination of domestic violence or child abuse before a family violence
indicator is placed on a record. The criteria for a family violence indicator in
Florida are in section 61.1825, Florida Statutes.
The records in these proceedings are confidential under 42 U.S.C. §§ 653
and 654. Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.051 [renumbered as 2.420 in
2006] also exempts from public disclosure any records made confidential by
federal law.
Committee Note
2008 Amendment. Chapter 2008-61, Laws of Florida, effective October 1,
2008, eliminated such terms as “custodial parent,” “noncustodial parent,” and
“visitation” from Chapter 61, Florida Statutes. Instead, the court adopts or
establishes a parenting plan that includes, among other things, a time-sharing
schedule for the minor children. These statutory changes are reflected in the
amendments to the definitions in this rule. However, because 42 U.S.C. § 653
includes the terms “custody” and “visitation,” these terms have not been excised
from the remainder of the rule.
155RULE 12.740. FAMILY MEDIATION
(a) related issues.
Applicability. This rule governs mediation of family matters and
(b) Referral. Except as provided by law and this rule, all contested
family matters and issues may be referred to mediation. Every effort shall be made
to expedite mediation of family issues.
(c) Limitation on Referral to Mediation. Unless otherwise agreed by
the parties, family matters and issues may be referred to a mediator or mediation
program which charges a fee only after the court has determined that the parties
have the financial ability to pay such a fee. This determination may be based upon
the parties’ financial affidavits or other financial information available to the court.
When the mediator’s fee is not established under section 44.108, Florida Statutes,
or when there is no written agreement providing for the mediator’s compensation,
the mediator shall be compensated at an hourly rate set by the presiding judge in
the referral order. The presiding judge may also determine the reasonableness of
the fees charged by the mediator. When appropriate, the court shall apportion
mediation fees between the parties and shall state each party’s share in the order of
referral. Parties may object to the rate of the mediator’s compensation within 15
days of the order of referral by serving an objection on all other parties and the
mediator.
(d) Appearances. Unless otherwise stipulated by the parties, a party is
deemed to appear at a family mediation convened pursuant to this rule if the named
party is physically present at the mediation conference. In the discretion of the
mediator and with the agreement of the parties, family mediation may proceed in
the absence of counsel unless otherwise ordered by the court.
(e) Completion of Mediation. Mediation shall be completed within 75
days of the first mediation conference unless otherwise ordered by the court.
(f) Report on Mediation.
(1) If agreement is reached as to any matter or issue, including
legal or factual issues to be determined by the court, the agreement shall be
reduced to writing, signed by the parties and their counsel, if any and if present,
and submitted to the court unless the parties agree otherwise. By stipulation of the
parties, the agreement may be electronically or stenographically recorded and
156made under oath or affirmed. In such event, an appropriately signed transcript may
be filed with the court.
(2) After the agreement is filed, the court shall take action as
required by law. When court approval is not necessary, the agreement shall
become binding upon filing. When court approval is necessary, the agreement shall
become binding upon approval. In either event, the agreement shall be made part
of the final judgment or order in the case.
(3) If the parties do not reach an agreement as to any matter as a
result of mediation, the mediator shall report the lack of an agreement to the court
without comment or recommendation. With the consent of the parties, the
mediator’s report may also identify any pending motions or outstanding legal
issues, discovery process, or other action by any party which, if resolved or
completed, would facilitate the possibility of a settlement.
Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule is similar to former Florida Rule of Civil
Procedure 1.740. All provisions concerning the compensation of the mediator have
been incorporated into this rule so that all mediator compensation provisions are
contained in one rule. Additionally, this rule clarifies language regarding the filing
of transcripts, the mediator’s responsibility for mailing a copy of the agreement to
counsel, and counsel’s filing of written objections to mediation agreements.
RULE 12.741. MEDIATION RULES
(a) Discovery. Unless stipulated by the parties or ordered by the court,
the mediation process shall not suspend discovery.
(b) General Procedures.
(1) Interim or Emergency Relief. A party may apply to the court
for interim or emergency relief at any time. Mediation shall continue while such a
motion is pending absent a contrary order of the court, or a decision of the
mediator to adjourn pending disposition of the motion. Time for completing

or some of the issues in the particular case.
(B) If the parties cannot agree upon a mediator within 10
days of the order of referral, the plaintiff or petitioner shall so notify the court
within 10 days of the expiration of the period to agree on a mediator, and the court

Commentary
1995 Adoption. This rule combines and replaces Florida Rules of Civil
Procedure 1.710, 1.720, and 1.730. The rule, as combined, is substantially similar
to those three previous rules, with the following exceptions. This rule deletes
subdivisions (a) and (b) of rule 1.710 and subdivisions (b) and (c) of rule 1.730.
This rule compliments Florida Family Law Rule of Procedure 12.740 by providing
direction regarding various procedures to be followed in family law mediation
proceedings.
RULE 12.742. PARENTING COORDINATION
(a) Applicability. This rule applies to parenting coordination.
(b) Qualification Process. Each judicial circuit shall establish a process
for determining that a parenting coordinator is qualified in accordance with the
requirements established in the parenting coordination section of Chapter 61,
Florida Statutes.
(c) Order Referring Parties to Parenting Coordinator. An order
referring the parties to a parenting coordinator must be in substantial compliance
with Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.984(a). The order must
specify the role, responsibility, and authority of the parenting coordinator.
(d) Appointment of Parenting Coordinator. The parties may agree in
writing on a parenting coordinator subject to the court’s approval. If the parties
cannot agree on a parenting coordinator, the court shall appoint a parenting
coordinator qualified by law.

must file a response accepting or declining the appointment in substantial
compliance with Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.984(b).
(f) Term of Service. The term of the parenting coordinator shall be as
specified in the order of appointment or as extended by the court. The initial term
of service shall not exceed two years. The court shall terminate the service on:
(1) The parenting coordinator's resignation or disqualification; or
159(2) A finding of good cause shown based on the court's own motion
or a party's written motion. Good cause includes, but is not limited to the
occurrence of domestic violence; circumstances that compromise the safety of any
person or the integrity of the process; or a finding that there is no longer a need for
the service of the parenting coordinator. The motion and notice of hearing shall
also be served on the parenting coordinator.
(g) Removal of Parenting Coordinator. The court shall remove the
parenting coordinator if the parenting coordinator becomes disqualified under the
parenting coordination section of Chapter 61, Florida Statutes, or if good cause if
shown.
(h) Appointment of Substitute Parenting Coordinator. If a parenting
coordinator cannot serve or continue to serve, a substitute parenting coordinator
may be chosen in the same manner as the original.
(i) Authority with Consent. The parenting coordinator may have
additional authority with express written consent. If there has been a history of
domestic violence the court must find that consent has been freely and voluntarily
given.
(1) coordinator may
With the express written consent of both parties, the parenting
(A) have temporary decision-making authority to resolve
specific non-substantive disputes between the parties until such time as a court
order is entered modifying the decision; or
(B) make recommendations to the court concerning
modifications to the parenting plan or time-sharing.
(2) coordinator may
With the express written consent of a party, a parenting
(A) information of that party; or
(B) have access to confidential and privileged records and

party to health care providers and to any other third parties.
160(3) coordinator may
With the express approval of the court, the parenting
(A) records and information; or

(B) provide confidential and privileged information for that
child to health care providers and to any other third parties.
(j) Limitation of Authority.
(1) A parenting coordinator shall not have decision making
authority to resolve substantive disputes between the parties. A dispute is
substantive if it would
(A) significantly change the quantity or decrease the quality
of time a child spends with either parent; or
(B) modify parental responsibility.
(2) A parenting coordinator shall not make a substantive
recommendation concerning parental responsibility or timesharing to the court
unless the court on its own motion or a joint motion of the parties determines that:
(A) there is an emergency as defined by the parenting
coordination section of Chapter 61, Florida Statutes,
(B) the recommendation would be in the best interest of the
child, and
(C) the parties agree that any parenting coordination
communications that may be raised to support or challenge the recommendation of
the parenting coordinator will be permitted.
(k) Emergency Order.
(1) Consideration by the Court. Upon the filing of an affidavit or
verified report of an emergency by the parenting coordinator, the court shall
determine whether the facts and circumstances contained in the report constitute an
emergency and whether an emergency order needs to be entered with or without
notice to the parties to prevent or stop furtherance of the emergency. Except for the
161entry of an ex parte order in accordance with (k)(2), the court shall set a hearing
with notice to the parties to be held at the earliest possible time.
(2) Ex Parte Order. An emergency order may be entered without
notice to the parties if it appears from the facts shown by the affidavit or verified
report that there is an immediate and present danger that the emergency situation
will occur before the parties can be heard. No evidence other than the affidavit or
verified report shall be used to support the emergency being reported unless the
parties appear at the hearing or have received notice of a hearing. Every temporary
order entered without notice in accordance with this rule shall be endorsed with the
date and hour of entry, be filed forthwith in the clerk's office, and define the injury
or potential injury, state findings by the court why the injury or potential injury
may be irreparable, and give the reasons why the order was granted without notice.
The court shall provide the parties and attorney ad litem, if one is appointed, with a
copy of the parenting coordinator's affidavit or verified report giving rise to the ex
parte order. A return hearing shall be scheduled if the court issues an emergency ex
parte order.
(3) Duration. The emergency order shall remain in effect until
further order.
(4) Motion to Dissolve or Modify Ex Parte Order. A motion to
modify or dissolve an ex parte emergency order must be heard within 5 days after
the movant applies for a hearing.
(l) Written Communication with Court. The parenting coordinator
may submit a written report or other written communication regarding any
nonconfidential matter to the court. Parenting coordinators was required, pursuant
to the parenting coordination section of Chapter 61, Florida Statutes, to report
certain emergencies to the court without giving notice to the parties. The parenting
coordinator shall use a form in substantial compliance with Florida Family Law
Rules of Procedure Form 12.984(c) when reporting any emergency to the court,
whether or not notice to the parties is required by law. If the parenting coordinator
is unable to adequately perform the duties in accordance with the court’s direction,
the parenting coordinator shall file a written request for a status conference and the
court shall set a timely status hearing. The parenting coordinator shall use a form in
substantial compliance with Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form
12.984(d) to request a status conference. When notice to the parties is required, the
parenting coordinator must contemporaneously serve each party with a copy of the
written communication.
162(m) Testimony and Discovery. A parenting coordinator shall not be
called to testify or be subject to the discovery rules of the Florida Family Law
Rules of Procedure unless the court makes a prior finding of good cause. A party
must file a motion, alleging good cause why the court should allow the parenting
coordinator to testify or be subject to discovery. The requesting party shall serve
the motion and notice of hearing on the parenting coordinator. The requesting party
shall initially be responsible for the parenting coordinator’s fees and costs incurred
as a result of the motion.
(n) Parenting Coordination Session. A parenting coordination session
occurs when a party and the parenting coordinator communicate with one another.
A parenting coordination session may occur in the presence or with the
participation of persons in addition to a party and the parenting coordinator. Unless
otherwise directed by the court, the parenting coordinator shall determine who may
be present during each parenting coordination session including, without
limitation, attorneys, parties, and other persons.
Committee Notes
2010 Adoption. The provisions of subdivision (k) do not abrogate the
confidentiality provisions of section 61.125, Florida Statutes. An exception to
confidentiality must apply before invoking this subdivision of the rule.
2014 Revision. Parties are more likely to comply with a parenting plan
which has been voluntarily and mutually self-determined by the parties without
undue outside influence. Courts therefore should consider referring parties to
mediation prior to parenting coordination when a parenting plan has not been
agreed to by the parties or adopted by the court. Courts are also encouraged to
review what additional forms of alternative dispute resolution as well as social,
psychological and educational interventions may best assist the parties in a timely
manner. In cases where parties are referred to a parenting coordinator to adopt or
create a parenting plan, the court should consider whether the parties would be
better served by the court determining certain aspects of the parenting plan (such as
parental responsibility, time sharing schedule, etc.) prior to referral to a parenting
coordinator. New subdivisions (b), (g), (j)(2), (l), and (n) were added and others
were renumbered accordingly.
163RULE 12.745. COLLABORATIVE LAW PROCESS
(a) III, Florida Statutes.
Application. This rule governs all proceedings under chapter 61, part
(b) Collaborative Law Process.
(1) Initiating Process.
(A) A collaborative law process begins, regardless of whether
a legal proceeding is pending, when the parties sign a collaborative law
participation agreement.
(B) When a proceeding is pending before a court, the parties
may sign a collaborative law participation agreement to seek to resolve a matter
related to the proceeding. The parties shall promptly file with the court a notice of
the agreement after it is signed and it shall operate as an application for a stay of
the proceeding. A court in which a proceeding is stayed under this subdivision
may require the parties and collaborative lawyers to provide a status report on the
collaborative law process and the proceeding. The status report may only indicate
whether the process is ongoing or concluded and no other information. The status
report may not include a report, assessment, recommendation, finding, or other
communication regarding a collaborative matter. A court shall provide notice to
the parties and an opportunity to be heard before dismissing a proceeding, in which
a notice of collaborative process is filed, based on delay or failure to prosecute. A
court may not consider a communication made in violation of this subdivision.
(2) process is concluded by:
Concluding and Terminating Process. A collaborative law
(A) the resolution of a collaborative matter as evidenced by a
signed record;
(B) the resolution of a part of the collaborative matter,
evidenced by a signed record, in which the parties agree that the remaining parts of
the matter will not be resolved in the process;
(C) process, with or without cause, by
a party unilaterally terminating the collaborative law
164(i) giving notice to other parties in a record that the
process is ended,
(ii) beginning a contested proceeding related to a
collaborative matter without the agreement of all parties, or
(iii) in a pending proceeding related to the matter:
cause, or request for a conference with the court;
a. b. initiating a pleading, motion, order to show
requesting that the proceeding be put on the
court’s active calendar; or
c. taking similar action requiring notice to be
sent to the parties; or
(D) except as otherwise provided by subdivision (b)(3), a
party discharging a collaborative lawyer or a collaborative lawyer withdrawing
from further representation of a party.
If a proceeding is pending before a court, the parties shall promptly
file with the court notice in a record when a collaborative law process concludes.
Any stay of the proceeding is lifted when the notice is filed. The notice may not
specify any reason for termination of the process.
(3) Discharge or Withdrawal from Representation. A party’s
collaborative lawyer shall give prompt notice to all other parties in a record of a
discharge or withdrawal. If a proceeding was pending prior to the initiation of the
collaborative process, the party’s collaborative lawyer shall comply with the
requirements of Florida Rule of Judicial Administration 2.505. Notwithstanding
the discharge or withdrawal of a collaborative lawyer, a collaborative law process
continues, if not later than 30 days after the date that the notice of the discharge or
withdrawal of a collaborative lawyer is sent to the parties:
(A) the unrepresented party retains a successor collaborative
lawyer; and
165(B) in a signed record:
(i) the parties consent to continue the process by
reaffirming the collaborative law participation agreement; and
(ii) the agreement is amended to identify the successor
collaborative lawyer and the successor attorney signs the participation agreement.
(c) Approval of Interim Agreements. A collaborative law process does
not conclude if, with the consent of the parties, a party requests a court to approve
a written agreement resolving an issue in the collaborative matter while other
issues remain pending.
(d) Alternative Dispute Resolution Permitted. Nothing in this rule shall
be construed to prohibit the parties from using, by mutual agreement, any other
permissible form of alternative dispute resolution to reach a settlement on any of
the issues included in the collaborative process.
(e) Emergency Order. During a collaborative law process, a court may
issue emergency orders to protect the health, safety, welfare, or interest of a party
or a family or household member as defined in section 741.28, Florida Statutes.
(f) Disqualification of Collaborative Lawyer and Lawyers in
Associated Law Firm.
(1) Except as otherwise provided in subdivision (f)(3), a
collaborative lawyer is disqualified from appearing before a court to represent a
party in a proceeding related to the collaborative matter.
(2) Except as otherwise provided in subdivisions (b)(3) and (c), a
lawyer in a law firm with which the collaborative lawyer is associated is
disqualified from appearing before a court to represent a party in a proceeding
related to the collaborative matter if the collaborative lawyer is disqualified from
doing so under subdivision (f)(1).
(3) A collaborative lawyer or a lawyer in a law firm with which the
collaborative lawyer is associated may represent a party:
166(A) to ask a court to approve an agreement resulting from the
collaborative law process; or
(B) to seek to defend an emergency order to protect the
health, safety, welfare, or interest of a party, or a family or household member as
defined in section 741.28, Florida Statutes, if a successor lawyer is not
immediately available to represent that person, but only until the party or family or
household member is represented by a successor lawyer or reasonable measures
are taken to protect the health, safety, welfare, or interest of that person.

provided shall be heard by all callers prior to speaking to self-help staff.
(i) Exemption. Self-help personnel are not required to complete Florida
Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a), Disclosure From Nonlawyer, as
required by rule 10-2.1, Rules Regulating The Florida Bar. The provisions in rule
10-2.1, Rules Regulating The Florida Bar, which require a nonlawyer to include

unless the self-help personnel recorded the information on the form as authorized
by this rule.
(j) Availability of Services. Self-help programs are available to all self-
represented litigants in family law cases.

Exclusion. Nothing in this rule shall restrict services provided by the clerk of the

Commentary
1998 Adoption. It should be emphasized that the personnel in the self-help
programs should not be providing legal advice to self-represented litigants. Self-
help personnel should not engage in any activities that constitute the practice of
law or inadvertently create an attorney-client relationship. Self-help programs
should consistently encourage self-represented litigants to seek legal advice from a
licensed attorney. The provisions of this rule only apply to programs established by
the chief judge.
Subdivision (b). This rule applies only to assistance offered in family law
cases. The types of family law cases included in a family law division may vary
based on local rule and it is anticipated that a local rule establishing a self-help
program may also exclude types of family law cases from the self-help program.
Programs may operate with lawyer personnel, nonlawyer personnel, or a
combination thereof.
Subdivision (c)(2). The self-help program is encouraged to cooperate with
the local bar to develop a workable system to provide this information. The
program may maintain information about members of The Florida Bar who are
willing to provide services to self-represented litigants. The program may not show
preference for a particular service, program, or attorney.
Subdivision (c)(3). In order to avoid the practice of law, the self-help
personnel should not recommend a specific course of action.
Subdivision (c)(5). Self-help personnel should not suggest the specific
information to be included in the blanks on the forms. Oral communications
between the self-help personnel and the self-represented litigant should be focused
on the type of information the form is designed to elicit.
Subdivision (c)(8). Self-help personnel should be familiar with the court
rules and the most commonly used statutory provisions. Requests for information
173beyond these commonly used statutory provisions would require legal research,
which is prohibited by subdivision (d)(8).
Subdivision (c)(9). Self-help personnel can have access to the court’s docket
and can provide information from the docket to the self-represented litigant.
Subdivision (f). Because an attorney-client relationship is not formed, the
information provided by a self-represented litigant is not confidential or privileged.
Subdivision (g). Because an attorney-client relationship is not formed, there
is no conflict in providing the limited services authorized under this rule to both
parties.
Subdivision (h). It is intended that self-represented litigants who receive
services from a self-help program understand that they are not receiving legal
services. One purpose of the disclosure is to prevent an attorney-client relationship
from being formed. In addition to the signed disclosure, it is recommended that
each program post the disclosure in a prominent place in the self-help program.
The written disclosure should be available and posted in the languages that are in
prevalent use in the county.
Subdivision (i). This provision is to clarify that nonlawyer personnel are not
required to use Florida Family Law Rules of Procedure Form 12.900(a) because
the information is included in the disclosure required by this rule. Self-help
personnel are required to include their name and identifying information on any
form on which they record information for a self-represented litigant.
174
