## Relevant Text on Co-Parenting and Cooperating with a Former Spouse

### 1. Dangers of Joint Counseling and Cooperation in Cases of Domestic Violence
The document emphasizes that couples counseling is dangerous and inappropriate in domestic violence situations, which has implications for any form of cooperation, including co-parenting.

- **From Page 1: "Couples Counseling is Dangerous Because It..."**
  - "Endangers victims"
  - "Can blame the victim when focusing on couple's interaction by ignoring the denial, minimization and deception"
  - "Increases the victim's isolation, as she may fear to speak in therapy sessions, for fear of retribution and more violence at home"
  - "Implies the victim is responsible for seeing that her batterer gets help"
  - **Relevance**: These points suggest that any joint interaction, such as co-parenting discussions, could endanger the victim by forcing communication or collaboration with an abusive former spouse. The risk of retribution and victim-blaming indicates that traditional co-parenting models requiring direct cooperation may not be safe.

- **From Page 1: "Couples Counseling is Not a Viable Therapeutic Tool in Domestic Violence Because..."**
  - "Couples counseling is beneficial for MARITAL problems, and domestic violence is a VIOLENT CRIMINAL ACT not a marital problem"
  - "Domestic violence is solely the responsibility of the offender, regardless of perspective or provocation"
  - "The offender alone is capable of changing his behavior"
  - **Relevance**: This clarifies that domestic violence is not a mutual issue to be resolved through cooperation. In co-parenting, this implies that the abusive former spouse bears sole responsibility for their actions, and the victim should not be pressured into joint efforts that assume shared accountability.

### 2. Conditions for Considering Joint Counseling or Cooperation
The document outlines strict prerequisites before engaging in couples counseling, which can inform when cooperation with a former spouse might be feasible in co-parenting scenarios.

- **From Page 1: "Do Not Engage in Couples Counseling Unless..."**
  - "The former batterer has completed a Batterer Intervention Program"
  - "The batterer has acknowledged his responsibility for his violent actions"
  - "The batterer recognizes his ability to stop his violence toward his partner and further clearly states that he will not be violent towards his partner"
  - "The victim validates, in separate session, that he has not been violent for one year and has affirmed his commitment to never be so again"
  - "The victim has supports in place and is actively progressing from dependence to freedom"
  - **Relevance**: These conditions suggest a cautious approach to any cooperation with a former spouse. For co-parenting, this means direct collaboration should only be considered after the abuser has completed a program, taken full responsibility, and demonstrated a year of non-violence, with the victim’s safety and autonomy ensured through external supports.

### 3. Legal and Professional Consensus on Avoiding Joint Approaches
Legal and advocacy organizations widely oppose joint counseling, which extends to cautioning against unstructured cooperation in post-separation relationships.

- **From Page 1: "Couples Counseling is Not Recommended By..."**
  - "The Department of Justice (prohibits)"
  - "The American Bar Association"
  - "Futures Without Violence"
  - "California Partnership to End Domestic Violence"
  - "All US State Coalitions Against DV"
  - "National Network to End DV"
  - "National Coalition Against DV"
  - **Relevance**: This consensus indicates that cooperation with a former spouse in co-parenting must be approached with extreme care, avoiding models that mirror the risks of couples counseling (e.g., forced interaction or mediation without safeguards).

- **From Page 2: "Couple's Counseling is Dangerous for Victims: Citations"**
  - "Judicial Subcommittee of the American Bar Association's Commission on Domestic Violence, 'Judicial Checklist' 2002. Page 2"
  - "National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) - Each of the 52-member state coalitions have standards and policies that state that couples counseling is dangerous for Battered Women and not recommended."
  - "California Penal Code Section 1203.097 (c)(1)(G) A requirement that [batterer's intervention programs] excludes any couple counseling or family counseling, or both. (c)(3)(D) No victim shall be compelled to participate in a program or counseling, and no program may condition a defendant's enrollment on participation by the victim."
  - **Relevance**: Legal frameworks, like California’s Penal Code, explicitly prohibit compelling victims into joint counseling or family counseling, suggesting that co-parenting arrangements should not mandate victim participation in cooperative settings without their consent and safety assured.

### 4. Focus on Individual Responsibility and Safety
The document stresses that the offender is solely accountable, guiding how cooperation should be structured to protect victims.

- **From Page 1: "Couples Counseling is Not a Viable Therapeutic Tool in Domestic Violence Because..."**
  - "Domestic violence is illegal"
  - "Domestic violence is solely the responsibility of the offender, regardless of perspective or provocation"
  - "Domestic violence is a chosen strategy"
  - **Relevance**: This reinforces that co-parenting should not place the burden on the victim to manage the abuser’s behavior. Interactions with a former spouse must prioritize the victim’s safety and not assume mutual responsibility for past abuse.

## Summary and Application to Co-Parenting
The document does not explicitly discuss co-parenting or cooperating with a former spouse, as its focus is on the dangers of couples counseling in domestic violence contexts. However, the extracted text provides indirect but vital guidance:

- **Safety as Priority**: Cooperation with a former spouse who has a history of domestic violence must prioritize the victim’s and children’s safety, avoiding direct or unstructured interactions that could replicate the risks of couples counseling (e.g., endangerment, isolation, or victim-blaming).
- **Abuser Accountability**: The abusive former spouse is solely responsible for their behavior, meaning co-parenting should not involve joint efforts that imply shared fault or require the victim to facilitate change.
- **Strict Conditions**: Any form of cooperation, such as co-parenting communication, should only occur if the abuser has completed a Batterer Intervention Program, acknowledged their actions, and demonstrated sustained non-violence (validated by the victim), with the victim having robust support systems.
- **Legal Protections**: Legal and professional guidelines caution against compelled joint activities, suggesting that co-parenting arrangements should be structured (e.g., through parallel parenting or third-party mediation) to protect the victim’s autonomy and well-being.

In practice, this means co-parenting with a former spouse in a domestic violence context may require alternatives to traditional cooperation, such as using legal intermediaries, supervised exchanges, or communication via apps, ensuring the victim is not exposed to further harm. The document underscores a trauma-informed approach, emphasizing safety over forced collaboration.
