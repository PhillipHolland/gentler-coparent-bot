marriage certificate form and forward it to the county clerk and recorder within sixty-three days
after the solemnization. Any person who fails to forward the marriage certificate to the county

not less than twenty dollars. An additional five-dollar late fee may be assessed for each
additional day of failure to comply with the forwarding requirements of this subsection (1) up to

14-2-111. Putative spouse. A person who has cohabited with another to whom he or she
is not legally married in the good faith belief that he or she was married to that person is a
putative spouse until knowledge of the fact that he or she is not legally married terminates his or
her status and prevents acquisition of further rights. A putative spouse acquires the rights
conferred upon a legal spouse, including the right to maintenance following termination of his or
her status, whether or not the marriage is prohibited under section 14-2-110, declared invalid, or
otherwise terminated by court action. If there is a legal spouse or other putative spouses, rights
acquired by a putative spouse do not supersede the rights of the legal spouse or those acquired by
other putative spouses, but the court shall apportion property, maintenance, and support rights
among the claimants as appropriate in the circumstances and in the interests of justice.

Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 27 of 247
Uncertified Printout(b) If a proceeding is brought under this article, and two or more child support orders
have been issued by tribunals of this state, another state, or a foreign country with regard to the
same obligor and same child, a tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the
obligor and individual obligee shall apply the following rules and by order shall determine which
order controls and must be recognized:
(1) If only one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this
article, the order of that tribunal controls.
(2) If more than one of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under
this article:
(A) An order issued by a tribunal in the current home state of the child controls; or
(B) If an order has not been issued in the current home state of the child, the order most
recently issued controls.
(3) If none of the tribunals would have continuing, exclusive jurisdiction under this
article, the tribunal of this state shall issue a child support order, which controls.
(c) If two or more child support orders have been issued for the same obligor and same
child, upon request of a party who is an individual or that is a support enforcement agency, a
tribunal of this state having personal jurisdiction over both the obligor and the obligee who is an
individual shall determine which order controls under subsection (b) of this section. The request
may be filed with a registration for enforcement or registration for modification pursuant to part
6 of this article, or may be filed as a separate proceeding.
(d) A request to determine which is the controlling order shall be accompanied by a copy
of every child support order in effect and the applicable record of payments. The requesting
party shall give notice of the request to each party whose rights may be affected by the
determination.
(e) The tribunal that issued the controlling order under subsection (a), (b), or (c) of this
section has continuing jurisdiction to the extent provided in section 14-5-205 or 14-5-206.
(f) A tribunal of this state that determines by order which is the controlling order under
subsection (b)(1), (b)(2), or (c) of this section, or that issues a new controlling order under
subsection (b)(3) of this section, shall state in that order:
(1) The basis upon which the tribunal made its determination;
(2) The amount of prospective support, if any; and
(3) The total amount of consolidated arrears and accrued interest, if any, under all of the
orders after all payments made are credited as provided by section 14-5-209.
(g) Within thirty days after issuance of an order determining which is the controlling
order, the party obtaining the order shall file a certified copy of it in each tribunal that issued or
registered an earlier order of child support. A party or support enforcement agency obtaining the
order that fails to file a certified copy is subject to appropriate sanctions by a tribunal in which
the issue of failure to file arises. The failure to file does not affect the validity or enforceability
of the controlling order.
(h) An order that has been determined to be the controlling order, or a judgment for
consolidated arrears of support and interest, if any, made pursuant to this section shall be
recognized in proceedings under this article.

PART 3
CIVIL PROVISIONS OF GENERAL APPLICATION
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
This article adds a wide variety of
procedural provisions to existing statutory
and procedural rules for civil cases. If there
is a conflict between those provisions found
for other litigation and UIFSA rules set forth
in this article, obviously UIFSA rules
prevail. For example, it is unlikely that a
state will have a provision for testimony by
telephone or audiovisual means in a final
hearing. Section 316 of this act creates such
a right for an out-of-state individual.
Revisions in this article shift the perspective
slightly to accommodate the inclusion of a
foreign support order in the equation. Many,
but not all, of the provisions in this article
are basedupon the fact that a party does not
"reside in this state." Application of these
provisions is not solely based on whether the
absent party resides in "another state," as
formerly was the case. Rather, three distinct
formulations are employed depending on the
intended application of the provisions:
"residing in a state;" "residing in . . . a
foreign country;" or "residing outside this
state." The third alternative is intentionally
the broadest because it includes persons
residing anywhere and is not limited to
persons residing in a "foreign country" as
defined in Section 102.
14-5-301. Proceedings under article. (a) Except as otherwise provided in this article,
this part 3 applies to all proceedings under this article.
(b) An individual petitioner or a support enforcement agency may initiate a proceeding
authorized under this article by filing a petition in an initiating tribunal for forwarding to a
responding tribunal or by filing a petition or a comparable pleading directly in a tribunal of
another state or foreign country which has or can obtain personal jurisdiction over the
respondent.

14-5-313. Costs and fees. (a) The petitioner may not be required to pay a filing fee or
other costs.
(b) If an obligee prevails, a responding tribunal of this state may assess against an

the initiating or the responding state or foreign country, except as provided by other law.
Attorney's fees may be taxed as costs, and may be ordered paid directly to the attorney, who may

priority over fees, costs, and expenses.
(c) The tribunal shall order the payment of costs and reasonable attorney's fees if it

PART 4
ESTABLISHMENT OF SUPPORT ORDER
OR DETERMINATION OF PARENTAGE
COMMENT
A fundamental principle of U.S.
jurisprudence is that our courts are open to
litigants with a valid cause of action. This
article makes clear this principle applies
tosupport actions, whether initiated by a
resident of the United States or of a foreign
nation.
14-5-401. Establishment of support order. (a) If a support order entitled to recognition
under this article has not been issued, a responding tribunal of this state with personal
jurisdiction over the parties may issue a support order if:
(1) The individual seeking the order resides outside this state; or
(2) The support enforcement agency seeking the order is located outside this state.
(b) The tribunal may issue a temporary child support order if the tribunal determines that
such an order is appropriate and the individual ordered to pay is:
(1) A presumed father of the child;
(2) Petitioning to have his paternity adjudicated;
(3) Identified as the father of the child through genetic testing;
(4) An alleged father who has declined to submit to genetic testing;
(5) Shown by clear and convincing evidence to be the father of the child;
(6) An acknowledged father as provided by section 19-4-105 (1)(e), C.R.S.;
(7) The mother of the child; or
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 39 of 247
Uncertified Printout(8) An individual who has been ordered to pay child support in a previous proceeding
and the order has not been reversed or vacated.
(c) Upon finding, after notice and opportunity to be heard, that an obligor owes a duty of
support, the tribunal shall issue a support order directed to the obligor and may issue other orders
pursuant to section 14-5-305.

PART 5
ENFORCEMENT OF ORDER OF
ANOTHER STATE WITHOUT REGISTRATION
Editor's note: This article was repealed and reenacted in 1993, and this part 5 was
subsequently amended with relocations in 1997, resulting in the addition, relocation, and
elimination of sections as well as subject matter. For amendments to this part 5 prior to 1997,
consult the Colorado statutory research explanatory note and the table itemizing the replacement
volumes and supplements to the original volume of C.R.S. 1973 beginning on page vii in the
front of this volume and the editor's note following the article heading. Former C.R.S. section
numbers prior to 1997 are shown in editor's notes following those sections that were relocated.
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
This article governs direct filing of
an income withholding order from one state
to an employer in another state. Except as
provided in Section 507, the provisions of
this article only apply to an interstate case
and do not apply to an income-withholding
order from a foreign country. While U.S.
employers routinely enforce sister state
income- withholding orders, enforcement of
the wide variety of possible foreign support
orderswould provide too many complexities
and challenges to justify requiring an
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 40 of 247
Uncertified Printoutemployer to interpret and enforce an
ostensible foreign income-withholding
order. Indeed, income- withholding orders
from a foreign country are quite rare at this
time, although instances of that enforcement
remedy probably will increase in the future.
14-5-501. Employer's receipt of income-withholding order of another state. An
income-withholding order issued in another state may be sent by or on behalf of the obligee, or
by the support enforcement agency, to the person defined as the obligor's employer under the
income-withholding law of this state without first filing a petition or comparable pleading or
registering the order with a tribunal of this state.

Editor's note: This section was formerly numbered as § 14-5-501 IP(a), and the other
provisions of former § 14-5-501 were relocated to § 14-5-502 in 1997.
Cross references: For the legislative declaration contained in the 1997 act amending this
section, see section 1 of chapter 236, Session Laws of Colorado 1997.
14-5-502. Employer's compliance with income-withholding order of another state.
(a) Upon receipt of an income-withholding order, the obligor's employer shall immediately
provide a copy of the order to the obligor.
(b) The employer shall treat an income-withholding order issued in another state which
appears regular on its face as if it had been issued by a tribunal of this state.
(c) Except as otherwise provided in subsection (d) of this section and section 14-5-503
the employer shall withhold and distribute the funds as directed in the withholding order by
complying with terms of the order which specify:
(1) The duration and amount of periodic payments of current child support, stated as a
sum certain;
(2) The person designated to receive payments and the address to which the payments
are to be forwarded;
(3) Medical support, whether in the form of periodic cash payment, stated as a sum
certain, or ordering the obligor to provide health insurance coverage for the child under a policy
available through the obligor's employment;
(4) The amount of periodic payments of fees and costs for a support enforcement
agency, the issuing tribunal, and the obligee's attorney, stated as sums certain; and
(5) The amount of periodic payments of arrearages and interest on arrearages, stated as
sums certain.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 41 of 247
Uncertified Printout(d) An employer shall comply with the law of the state of the obligor's principal place of
employment for withholding from income with respect to:
(1) The employer's fee for processing an income-withholding order;
(2) The maximum amount permitted to be withheld from the obligor's income; and
(3) The times within which the employer must implement the withholding order and
forward the child support payment.

14-5-503. Employer's compliance with two or more income-withholding orders. If an
obligor's employer receives two or more income-withholding orders with respect to the earnings
of the same obligor, the employer satisfies the terms of the orders if the employer complies with
the law of the state of the obligor's principal place of employment to establish the priorities for
withholding and allocating income withheld for two or more child support obligees.

an income-withholding order issued in another state and received for enforcement is subject to
the same penalties that may be imposed for noncompliance with an order issued by a tribunal of
this state.

order had been issued by a tribunal of this state.
(b) The obligor shall give notice of the contest to:
(1) A support enforcement agency providing services to the obligee;
(2) Each employer that has directly received an income-withholding order relating to the
obligor; and

order to a support enforcement agency of this state.
(b) Upon receipt of the documents, the support enforcement agency, without initially
seeking to register the order, shall consider and, if appropriate, use any administrative procedure
authorized by the law of this state to enforce a support order or an income-withholding order, or

PART 6
REGISTRATION, ENFORCEMENT, AND MODIFICATION
OF SUPPORT ORDER
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 43 of 247
Uncertified PrintoutSections 601 through 604 establish
the basic procedure for the registration of a
support order from another state or a foreign
support order. Under RURESA when a
tribunal of a responding state was requested
to register and enforce an existing
child-support order, the common practice
was to ignore the request; rather, a separate
proceeding would be initiated for the
establishment of a new support order. This
practice was specifically rejected by UIFSA;
this practice under RURESA created the
multiple support-order system that UIFSA
was specifically designed to eliminate.
Under Sections 205 through 207 the
one-order system allows only one existing
order to be enforced prospectively.
Sections 605 through 608 provide
theprocedure for the nonregistering party to
contest registration of an order, either
because the order is allegedly invalid,
superseded, or no longer in effect, or
because the enforcement remedy being
sought is opposed by the nonregistering
party. Other enforcement remedies may be
available without resort to the UIFSA
process under the law of the responding
state. See Section 104.
The registration and enforcement
provisions in Sections 601 through 608 are
consistent with the "recognition and
enforcement" provisions of the Convention.
The terms of this article and Article 7
suffice to direct international support orders
into the proper channels.

REGISTRATION AND MODIFICATION
OF CHILD SUPPORT ORDER OF ANOTHER STATE
INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 48 of 247
Uncertified PrintoutAuthority to modify a child-support
order of another state depends on the
interaction of these sections with the
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction of the
issuing tribunal. See Sections 205 through
206. This also might involve the
determination of the controlling order in a
situation involving multiple child-support
orders. These concepts are not present in the
international context. See Sections 615, 616,
and 711. Thus, modification of a support
order from a foreign country other than a
Convention country is not governed by
Sections 609-614, but is subject to Sections
615-616, infra.
Sections 609 through 614 apply only
to modification of an interstate child-support
order. Most of the act applies to "a support
order," which includes both child-support
and spousal support. Both categories are
generally subject to interstate enforcement
underUIFSA. But, as a practical matter, the
actual process of that enforcement is quite
different. Child support is enforced almost
exclusively by governmentally sponsored
Title IV-D agencies, which also may enforce
spousal support if it is included in the same
order. In some states, local funds are
appropriated for enforcement of spousal
support as well. Only occasionally will a
private attorney be involved in a
child-support case, but spousal support not
issued in conjunction with a child-support
order generally requires representation pro
se or by private counsel. More importantly,
a tribunal of a responding state may enforce
spousal support, but it does not have
authority to modify a spousal-support order
of another state or foreign country unless the
law of that jurisdiction does not assert
continuing, exclusive jurisdiction over its
order. See Section 211.
14-5-609. Procedure to register child support order of another state for
modification. A party or support enforcement agency seeking to modify, or to modify and
enforce, a child support order issued in another state shall register that order in this state in the
same manner provided in sections 14-5-601 through 14-5-608 if the order has not been
registered. A petition for modification may be filed at the same time as a request for registration,
or later. The pleading must specify the grounds for modification.

14-5-611. Modification of child support order of another state. (a) If section
14-5-613 does not apply, upon petition a tribunal of this state may modify a child support order
issued in another state which order is registered in this state if, after notice and hearing, the
tribunal finds that:
(1) The following requirements are met:
(A) Neither the child, nor the obligee who is an individual, nor the obligor resides in the
issuing state;
(B) A petitioner who is a nonresident of this state seeks modification; and
(C) The respondent is subject to the personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state; or
(2) This state is the residence of the child or a party who is an individual is subject to the
personal jurisdiction of the tribunal of this state, and all of the parties who are individuals have
filed consents in a record in the issuing tribunal for a tribunal of this state to modify the support
order and assume continuing, exclusive jurisdiction.
(b) Modification of a registered child support order is subject to the same requirements,
procedures, and defenses that apply to the modification of an order issued by a tribunal of this
state and the order may be enforced and satisfied in the same manner.
(c) A tribunal of this state may not modify any aspect of a child support order that may
not be modified under the law of the issuing state, including the duration of the obligation of
support. If two or more tribunals have issued child support orders for the same obligor and same
child, the order that controls and must be so recognized under section 14-5-207 establishes the
aspects of the support order which are nonmodifiable.
(d) In a proceeding to modify a child support order, the law of the state that is
determined to have issued the initial controlling order governs the duration of the obligation of
support. The obligor's fulfillment of the duty of support established by that order precludes
imposition of a further obligation of support by a tribunal of this state.
(e) On issuance of an order by a tribunal of this state modifying a child support order
issued in another state, the tribunal of this state becomes the tribunal having continuing,
exclusive jurisdiction.
(f) Notwithstanding subsections (a) through (e) of this section and section 14-5-201 (b),
a tribunal of this state retains jurisdiction to modify an order issued by a tribunal of this state if:
(1) One party resides in another state; and
(2) The other party resides outside the United States.

effective date of the modification; and
(3) Shall recognize the modifying order of the other state, upon registration, for the
purpose of enforcement.

individual parties reside in this state. (a) If all of the parties who are individuals reside in this
state and the child does not reside in the issuing state, a tribunal of this state has jurisdiction to
enforce and to modify the issuing state's child support order in a proceeding to register that
order.
(b) A tribunal of this state exercising jurisdiction under this section shall apply the

this state to the proceeding for enforcement or modification. Parts 3, 4, 5, 7, and 8 of this article

INTRODUCTORY COMMENT
This article contains provisions
adapted from the Convention that could not
be readily integrated into the existing body
of Articles 1 through 6. For the most part,
extending the coverage of UIFSA (2008) to
foreign countries was a satisfactory solution
to merge the appropriate Convention terms
into this act. In understanding this process, it
must be clearly stated that the terms of the
Convention are not substantive law.
The Convention is a multilateral
treaty which binds the United States and the
other Convention countries to assure
compliance. As such, it will be the law of
the land; but the treaty is not self-executing.
See,Medellin v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491, 128
S.Ct. 1346, 170 L.Ed.2d 190 (2008). Thus,
the ultimate enforcement of the treaty in the
United States is dependent on the key
implementing federal law and the enactment
of both federal and state legislation which
provide the mechanism for enforcing the
requirements of the Convention. This act is
predicated on the principle that the
enactment of UIFSA (2008) in all States and
federal jurisdictions will effectively
implement the Convention through state law
by amending Articles 1 through 6, plus the
addition of this article. The treaty, in
essence, establishes the framework for a
system of internationalcooperation by
emulating the interstate effect of UIFSA for
international cases, especially those affected
by the Convention.
In relatively few instances, the
provisions of the Convention are sufficiently
specific that a choice was made between
amending UIFSA accordingly, with a
disproportionate effect on all support orders
enforced under state law, or accommodating
potential conflicts by creating a separate
article to apply only to Convention support
orders. The choice was to draft this article as
state law to minimize disruption to interstate
support orders, which constitute the vast
majority of orders processed under UIFSA.
Note that this act is the substantive and
procedural state law for: (1) responding to
an application for establishment, recognition
and enforcement, or modification of a
Convention support order; and, (2) initiating
an application to a Convention country for
similar action.
The four Hague maintenance
conventions that preceded the 2007
Convention, and the three prior versions of
UIFSA, have common goals. The
distinctions between the jurisdictional rules
in the common-law tradition in the United
States, and the civil law systems in most of
the countries that were parties to the earlier
maintenance conventions, were obstacles to
participation of the United States in any of
the multilateral maintenance treaties. As the
world has grown smaller and globalization
has become the order of the day, reconciling
the differences has become more and more
important. Understanding the necessity for
accommodation has made the task easier.
This is not to say easy, as evidenced by the
fact that the formal negotiations leading to
the final text of the Convention spanned
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 53 of 247
Uncertified Printoutfrom May, 2003, to November, 2007.
The United States signed the
Convention on November 23, 2007 and the
Senate gave its advice and consent
toratification in 2010. Enabling federal
legislation was enacted on September 29,
2014 which requires all states to enact
UIFSA (2008) by the end of 2015. At that
point the United States will deposit its
instrument of ratification and the
Convention will enter into force in the
United States.
UIFSA (2008) and the 2007
Convention have far more in common than
did former uniform acts and maintenance
conventions, and, in fact, many provisions
of the Convention are modeled on UIFSA
principles. The negotiations demonstrated
that it is possible to draft an international
convention, which incorporates core UIFSA
principles into a system for the
establishment and enforcement of child
support and spousal-support orders across
international borders, and creates an
efficient, economical, and expeditious
procedure to accomplish these goals.
Matters in common, however, go far beyond
identical goals. The negotiations provided
an opportunity for an extended interchange
of ideas about how to adapt legal
mechanisms to facilitate child support
enforcement between otherwise disparate
legal systems.
I n t e r n a t i o n a l c r o s s - b o r d e r
enforcement has been far more important in
Western Europe, and more recently,
throughout the countries of the European
Union than has been the case in the United
States. On the other hand, experience with
establishment and enforcement of interstate
child-support orders in the United States has
been building since 1950, and accelerated
rapidly with enactment of Title IV-D of the
Social Security Act in 1975. Clearly, the
issues are far easier to deal with nationally
because of the common language, currency,
and legal system, and, since 1996, with the
Title IV-D requirement that all states enact
the same version of UIFSA. In fact, since
the advent of UIFSA and Title IV-D,
millions of interstate cases have been
p r o c e s s e d t h r o u g h t h e c h i l d
supportenforcement system and thousands
of support orders from other countries have
also been registered and enforced in the
United States because UIFSA treated such
orders as if they had been entered by one of
the states. In the future, in Convention
countries, this country's orders will be
entitled to similar treatment. The entry into
force of the Convention is designed to
further improve the process and will most
certainly lead in a few years to a substantial
increase in international cases, both
incoming and outgoing.
To create UIFSA (2008), it
wasnecessary to integrate the texts of
UIFSA (2001) and the Convention. This did
not present a significant drafting challenge
for the most part. By far the most common
amendment in Articles 1 through 6 is to
substitute "state or foreign country" for the
term "state." These simple amendments
expanded a majority of this act to cover
foreign support orders. In this article
statutory directions are given to "a tribunal
of this state," and also to a "governmental
entity, individual petitioner, support
enforcement agency, or a party.

parties and having the same purpose if the more recent support order is entitled to recognition
and enforcement under this article in this state;

PART 8
INTERSTATE RENDITION
Cross references: For extradition procedures generally, see article 19 of title 16.
14-5-801. Grounds for rendition. (a) For purposes of this part 8, "governor" includes
an individual performing the functions of governor or the executive authority of a state covered
by this article.
(b) The governor of this state may:
(1) Demand that the governor of another state surrender an individual found in the other
state who is charged criminally in this state with having failed to provide for the support of an
obligee; or
(2) On the demand of the governor of another state, surrender an individual found in this
state who is charged criminally in the other state with having failed to provide for the support of
an obligee.
(c) A provision for extradition of individuals not inconsistent with this article applies to
the demand even if the individual whose surrender is demanded was not in the demanding state
when the crime was allegedly committed and has not fled therefrom.

14-5-802. Conditions of rendition. (a) Before making a demand that the governor of
another state surrender an individual charged criminally in this state with having failed to
provide for the support of an obligee, the governor of this state may require a prosecutor of this
state to demonstrate that at least sixty days previously the obligee had initiated proceedings for
support pursuant to this article or that the proceeding would be of no avail.
(b) If, under this article or a law substantially similar to this article, the governor of
another state makes a demand that the governor of this state surrender an individual charged
criminally in that state with having failed to provide for the support of a child or other individual
to whom a duty of support is owed, the governor may require a prosecutor to investigate the
demand and report whether a proceeding for support has been initiated or would be effective. If
it appears that a proceeding would be effective but has not been initiated, the governor may
delay honoring the demand for a reasonable time to permit the initiation of a proceeding.
(c) If a proceeding for support has been initiated and the individual whose rendition is
demanded prevails, the governor may decline to honor the demand. If the petitioner prevails and
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 61 of 247

decline to honor the demand if the individual is complying with the support order.

the parent, legal guardian, or other person responsible for the support of such child such sum for
the care, support, and maintenance of the child as may be reasonable therefor, and in no case
shall such sum be less than the per capita monthly or yearly amount of expense in the institution
in which the child is confined or the actual expense incurred by the state or county for the care
and maintenance of such child. Any action or proceeding by the state or county against any
parent shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure in civil cases. In case any action is
maintained by the state, it shall be brought in the name of the people of the state of Colorado,
and any moneys recovered in any action shall be paid to the state treasurer and credited to the

maintenance of such child, such action shall be in the name of the board of county
commissioners of such county or other body performing the functions of a board of county
commissioners, and any amount collected in any such action shall be paid to the county treasurer
of such county. When such action is prosecuted to a final judgment and judgment is rendered in
favor of the people of the state of Colorado or the board of county commissioners of the county
prosecuting such action, as the case may be, an execution may issue against the property of the
defendant as in other civil cases.

construed and applied to promote its underlying purposes.
(2) The underlying purposes of this article 10 are:
(a) To promote the amicable settlement of disputes that have arisen between parties to a
marriage;
(b) To mitigate the potential harm to the spouses and their children caused by the
process of legal dissolution of marriage;
(c) To make the law of legal dissolution of marriage more effective for dealing with the
realities of matrimonial experience by making an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage
relationship the sole basis for its dissolution; and
(d) To provide safeguards for a parent with a disability, pursuant to the provisions of
section 24-34-805.

the context otherwise requires, the term "decree" includes the term "judgment"; and, for the
purposes of the tax laws of the state of Colorado or of any other jurisdiction, the term
"maintenance" includes the term "alimony"
.
(2) Whenever any law of this state refers to or mentions divorce, annulment, or separate
maintenance, said law shall be interpreted as if the words dissolution of marriage, declaration of
invalidity of marriage, and legal separation, respectively, were substituted therefor.
(3) On and after July 1, 1993, the term "visitation" has been changed to "parenting time".
It is not the intent of the general assembly to modify or change the meaning of the term
"visitation" nor to alter the legal rights of a parent with respect to the child as a result of
changing the term "visitation" to "parenting time".
(4) On and after February 1, 1999, the term "custody" and related terms such as
"custodial" and "custodian" have been changed to "parental responsibilities". It is not the intent
of the general assembly to modify or change the meaning of the term "custody" nor to alter the
legal rights of any custodial parent with respect to the child as a result of changing the term
"custody" to "parental responsibilities".
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 70 of 247

proceedings for allocation of parental responsibilities pursuant to section 14-10-123 (1.5) only,
the term "child" means an unmarried individual who has not attained twenty-one years of age.

applied and construed as to effectuate its general purpose to make uniform the law with respect
to the subject of this article among those states which enact it.

having a like import in the law of other jurisdictions adopting this or a similar law.

14-10-104.5. Legislative declaration. The general assembly recognizes that it is in the
best interests of the parties to a marriage in which a dissolution has been granted and in which
there are children of the marriage for the parties to be able to resolve disputes that arise
subsequent to the dissolution in an amicable and fair manner. The general assembly further
recognizes that, in most cases, it is in the best interests of the children of the marriage to have a
relationship with both parents, including a parent with a disability, and that, in most cases, it is
the parents' right to have a relationship with their children. The general assembly emphasizes
that one of the underlying purposes of this article 10 is to mitigate the potential harm to the
spouses and their children and the relationships between the parents and their children caused by
the process of legal dissolution of marriage. The general assembly recognizes that when a
marriage in which children are involved is dissolved, both parties either agree to or are subject to
orders that contain certain obligations and commitments. The general assembly declares that the
honoring and enforcing of those obligations and commitments made by both parties are
necessary to maintaining a relationship that is in the best interest of the children of the marriage.
Therefore, the general assembly declares that both parties should honor and fulfill all of the
obligations and commitments made between the parties and ordered by the court.

the parties or the minor children or any policy of life insurance that names either of the parties or
the minor children as a beneficiary.

injunction, or modification or revocation under section 14-10-108.

14-10-112. Separation agreement. (1) To promote the amicable settlement of disputes

marriage, the parties may enter into a written separation agreement containing provisions for the
maintenance of either of them, the disposition of any property owned by either of them, and the
allocation of parental responsibilities, support, and parenting time of their children.
(2) In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or for legal separation, the terms of the
separation agreement, except terms providing for the allocation of parental responsibilities,
support, and parenting time of children, are binding upon the court unless it finds, after
considering the economic circumstances of the parties and any other relevant evidence produced
by the parties, on their own motion or on request of the court, that the separation agreement is
unconscionable.
(3) If the court finds the separation agreement unconscionable, the court may request the
parties to submit a revised separation agreement, or the court may make orders for the
disposition of property, support, and maintenance.
(4) If the court finds that the separation agreement is not unconscionable as to support,
maintenance, and property:
(a) Unless the separation agreement provides to the contrary, its terms shall be set forth
in the decree of dissolution or legal separation, and the parties shall be ordered to perform them;
or
(b) If the separation agreement provides that its terms shall not be set forth in the decree,
the decree shall identify the separation agreement and shall state that the court has found the
terms not unconscionable.
(5) Terms of the agreement set forth in the decree may be enforced by all remedies
available for the enforcement of a judgment, including contempt, but are no longer enforceable
as contract terms.
(6) Except for terms concerning the support, the allocation of decision-making
responsibility, or parenting time of children, the decree may expressly preclude or limit
modification of terms set forth in the decree if the separation agreement so provides.

marriage or in a proceeding for legal separation or in a proceeding for disposition of property
following the previous dissolution of marriage by a court which at the time of the prior
dissolution of the marriage lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent spouse or lacked
jurisdiction to dispose of the property, the court, subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of
this section, shall set apart to each spouse his or her property and shall divide the marital
property, without regard to marital misconduct, in such proportions as the court deems just after
considering all relevant factors including:
(a) The contribution of each spouse to the acquisition of the marital property, including
the contribution of a spouse as homemaker;
(b) The value of the property set apart to each spouse;
(c) The economic circumstances of each spouse at the time the division of property is to
become effective, including the desirability of awarding the family home or the right to live
therein for reasonable periods to the spouse with whom any children reside the majority of the
time; and
(d) Any increases or decreases in the value of the separate property of the spouse during
the marriage or the depletion of the separate property for marital purposes.
(2) For purposes of this article only, and subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of
this section, "marital property" means all property acquired by either spouse subsequent to the
marriage except:
(a) Property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent;
(b) Property acquired in exchange for property acquired prior to the marriage or in
exchange for property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or descent;
(c) Property acquired by a spouse after a decree of legal separation; and
(d) Property excluded by valid agreement of the parties.
(3) Subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, all property acquired by
either spouse subsequent to the marriage and prior to a decree of legal separation is presumed to
be marital property, regardless of whether title is held individually or by the spouses in some
form of coownership such as joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety, and
community property. The presumption of marital property described in this subsection (3) is
overcome by a showing that the property was acquired by a method listed in subsection (2) of
this section.
(4) Subject to the provisions of subsection (7) of this section, an asset of a spouse
acquired prior to the marriage or in accordance with subsection (2)(a) or (2)(b) of this section
shall be considered as marital property, for purposes of this article only, to the extent that its
present value exceeds its value at the time of the marriage or at the time of acquisition if
acquired after the marriage.
(5) For purposes of this section only, property shall be valued as of the date of the decree
or as of the date of the hearing on disposition of property if such hearing precedes the date of the
decree.

14-10-114. Spousal maintenance - advisory guidelines - legislative declaration -
definitions. (1) Legislative declaration. (a) The general assembly hereby finds that:
(I) The economic lives of spouses are frequently closely intertwined in marriage and that
it is often impossible to later segregate the respective decisions and contributions of the spouses;
and
(II) Consequently, awarding spousal maintenance may be appropriate if a spouse needs
support and the other spouse has the ability to pay support.
(b) The general assembly further finds that:
(I) Because the statutes provide little guidance to the court concerning maintenance
awards, there has been inconsistency in the amount and term of maintenance awarded in
different judicial districts across the state in cases that involve similar factual circumstances; and
(II) Courts and litigants would benefit from the establishment of a more detailed
statutory framework that includes advisory guidelines to be considered as a starting point for the
determination of fair and equitable maintenance awards.
(c) Therefore, the general assembly declares that it is appropriate to create a statutory
framework for the determination of maintenance awards, including advisory guidelines for the
amount and term of maintenance in certain cases, that will assist the court and the parties in
crafting maintenance awards that are fair, equitable, and more consistent across judicial districts
and in their application to both parties.
(2) At the time of permanent orders in dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or
declaration of invalidity proceedings, and upon the request of either party, the court may order
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 87 of 247
Uncertified Printoutthe payment of maintenance from one spouse to the other pursuant to the provisions of this
section. An award of maintenance shall be in an amount and for a term that is fair and equitable
to both parties and shall be made without regard to marital misconduct.
(3) (a) (I) Determination of maintenance. When a party has requested maintenance in a
dissolution of marriage, legal separation, or declaration of invalidity proceeding, prior to
granting or denying an award of maintenance, the court shall make initial written or oral findings
concerning:
(A) The amount of each party's gross income;
(B) The marital property apportioned to each party;
(C) The financial resources of each party, including but not limited to the actual or
potential income from separate or marital property;
(D) Reasonable financial need as established during the marriage; and
(E) Whether maintenance awarded pursuant to this section would be deductible for
federal income tax purposes by the payor and taxable income to the recipient.
(II) After making the initial findings described in subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (a),
the court shall determine the amount and term of the maintenance award, if any, that is fair and
equitable to both parties after considering:
(A) The guideline amount and term of maintenance set forth in paragraph (b) of this
subsection (3), if applicable, based upon the duration of the marriage and the combined gross
incomes of the parties;
(B) The factors relating to the amount and term of maintenance set forth in paragraph (c)
of this subsection (3); and
(C) Whether the party seeking maintenance has met the requirement for a maintenance
award pursuant to paragraph (d) of this subsection (3).
(b) Advisory guideline amount and term of maintenance. If the duration of the
parties' marriage is at least three years and the parties' combined annual adjusted gross income
does not exceed two hundred forty thousand dollars, the court shall make additional oral or
written findings concerning the duration of the marriage in whole months and the advisory
guideline amount and term of maintenance, calculated as follows:
(I) (A) If the maintenance award is deductible for federal income tax purposes by the
payor and taxable income to the recipient, the amount of maintenance under the advisory
guidelines is equal to forty percent of the parties' combined monthly adjusted gross income
minus the lower income party's monthly adjusted gross income. If the calculation results in a
negative number, the amount of maintenance is zero.
(B) If the maintenance award is not deductible for federal income tax purposes by the
payor and not taxable income to the recipient, the amount of maintenance under the advisory
guidelines for parties with a combined monthly adjusted gross income of ten thousand dollars or
less is equal to eighty percent of the amount calculated pursuant to subsection (3)(b)(I)(A) of this
section.
(C) If the maintenance award is not deductible for federal income tax purposes by the
payor spouse and not taxable income to the recipient spouse, the amount of maintenance under
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 88 of 247
Uncertified Printoutthe advisory guidelines for parties with a combined monthly adjusted gross income of more than
ten thousand dollars but not more than twenty thousand dollars is equal to seventy-five percent
of the amount calculated pursuant to subsection (3)(b)(I)(A) of this section.
(II) (A) The advisory term of maintenance under the guidelines, calculated in whole
months, for marriages of at least three years but not more than twenty years, is set forth in the
table contained in subsection (3)(b)(II)(B) of this section. When the duration of the parties'
marriage exceeds twenty years, the court may award maintenance for a specified term of years or
for an indefinite term, but the court shall not specify a maintenance term that is less than the
maintenance term under the guidelines for a twenty-year marriage without making specific
findings that support a reduced term of maintenance.

(c) Factors affecting the amount and term of maintenance. In any proceeding for
maintenance, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including but not limited to:
(I) The financial resources of the recipient spouse, including the actual or potential
income from separate or marital property or any other source and the ability of the recipient
spouse to meet his or her needs independently;
(II) The financial resources of the payor spouse, including the actual or potential income
from separate or marital property or any other source and the ability of the payor spouse to meet
his or her reasonable needs while paying maintenance;
(III) The lifestyle during the marriage;
(IV) The distribution of marital property, including whether additional marital property
may be awarded to reduce or alleviate the need for maintenance;
(V) Both parties' income, employment, and employability, obtainable through reasonable
diligence and additional training or education, if necessary, and any necessary reduction in
employment due to the needs of an unemancipated child of the marriage or the circumstances of
the parties;
(VI) Whether one party has historically earned higher or lower income than the income
reflected at the time of permanent orders and the duration and consistency of income from
overtime or secondary employment;
(VII) The duration of the marriage;
(VIII) The amount of temporary maintenance and the number of months that temporary
maintenance was paid to the recipient spouse;
(IX) The age and health of the parties, including consideration of significant health-care
needs or uninsured or unreimbursed health-care expenses;
(X) Significant economic or noneconomic contribution to the marriage or to the
economic, educational, or occupational advancement of a party, including but not limited to
completing an education or job training, payment by one spouse of the other spouse's separate
debts, or enhancement of the other spouse's personal or real property;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 89 of 247
Uncertified Printout(XI) Whether the circumstances of the parties at the time of permanent orders warrant
the award of a nominal amount of maintenance in order to preserve a claim of maintenance in
the future;
(XII) Whether the maintenance is deductible for federal income tax purposes by the
payor and taxable income to the recipient, and any adjustments to the amount of maintenance to
equitably allocate the tax burden between the parties; and
(XIII) Any other factor that the court deems relevant.
(d) After considering the provisions of this section and making the required findings of
fact, the court shall award maintenance only if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance lacks
sufficient property, including marital property apportioned to him or her, to provide for his or her
reasonable needs and is unable to support himself or herself through appropriate employment or
is the custodian of a child whose condition or circumstances make it inappropriate for the spouse
to be required to seek employment outside the home.
(e) The maintenance guidelines set forth in paragraph (b) of this subsection (3) do not
create a presumptive amount or term of maintenance. The court has discretion to determine the
award of maintenance that is fair and equitable to both parties based upon the totality of the
circumstances. The court shall make specific written or oral findings in support of the amount
and term of maintenance awarded pursuant to this section or an order denying maintenance.
(f) The court may award additional marital property to the recipient spouse or otherwise
adjust the distribution of marital property or debt to alleviate the need for maintenance or to
reduce the amount or term of maintenance awarded.
(g) The court may reserve jurisdiction to establish, review, or modify an award of
maintenance at a later date pursuant to the provisions of this section by setting forth:
(I) The reasons for reserving jurisdiction;
(II) The ascertainable future event that forms the basis for reserving jurisdiction; and
(III) A reasonably specific time within which maintenance may be considered pursuant
to this section.
(h) The court may award maintenance in short-term marriages, including marriages of
less than three years in duration, when, given the circumstances of the parties, the distribution of
marital property is insufficient to achieve an equitable result. In determining the award of
maintenance, the court may consider the maintenance guidelines and the relevant factors
affecting the amount and term of maintenance set forth in this subsection (3). The court shall
make written or oral findings pursuant to paragraph (e) of this subsection (3).
(i) Nothing in this section prohibits an award of maintenance in gross.
(3.5) Combined annual adjusted gross income in excess of advisory guideline
amount. If the parties' combined annual adjusted gross income exceeds two hundred forty
thousand dollars, the calculation methodology described in subsection (3)(b)(I) of this section for
determining the advisory guideline amount of maintenance does not apply, and the court shall
instead consider the factors set forth in subsection (3)(c) of this section in determining the
amount of maintenance. The court may consider the advisory guideline term of maintenance set
forth in subsection (3)(b)(II) of this section.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 90 of 247
Uncertified Printout(4) Temporary maintenance. (a) (I) In every proceeding for dissolution of marriage,
legal separation, or declaration of invalidity where temporary maintenance is requested by a
party, the court may award a monthly amount of temporary maintenance pursuant to the
provisions of subsection (3) of this section that are relevant to a determination of temporary
maintenance.
(II) The guideline term of maintenance set forth in subparagraph (II) of paragraph (b) of
subsection (3) of this section does not apply to temporary maintenance orders. The court shall
determine the term for payment of temporary maintenance.
(III) In addition to the relevant factors set forth in paragraph (c) of subsection (3) of this
section, the court shall consider any additional factors specific to the determination of temporary
maintenance, including the payment of family expenses and debts.
(b) After determining the amount of temporary maintenance pursuant to this subsection
(4) and the amount of temporary child support pursuant to section 14-10-115, the court shall
consider the respective financial resources of each party and determine the temporary payment
of marital debt and the temporary allocation of marital property.
(c) A determination of temporary maintenance does not prejudice the rights of either
party at permanent orders.
(5) Modification or termination of maintenance. (a) Except upon written agreement
of the parties, an award of maintenance entered pursuant to this section may be modified or
terminated pursuant to the provisions of section 14-10-122. The court may consider the guideline
amount and term of maintenance and the statutory factors set forth in subsection (3) of this
section only in a modification or termination proceeding concerning a maintenance award
entered on or after January 1, 2014.
(b) The enactment of this section does not constitute a substantial and continuing change
of circumstance for purposes of modifying maintenance orders entered before January 1, 2014.
(c) The enactment of the December 2017 "Tax Cuts and Jobs Act", Pub.L. 115-97,
federal tax legislation, does not constitute a substantial and continuing change of circumstance
for purposes of modifying maintenance orders entered prior to the effective date of that law.
(6) Security for the payment of maintenance. (a) The court may require the payor
spouse to provide reasonable security for the payment of maintenance in the event of the payor
spouse's death prior to the end of the maintenance term.
(b) Reasonable security may include, but need not be limited to, maintenance of life
insurance for the benefit of the recipient spouse. In entering an order to maintain life insurance,
the court shall consider:
(I) The age and insurability of the payor spouse;
(II) The cost of the life insurance;
(III) The amount and term of the maintenance;
(IV) Whether the parties carried life insurance during the marriage;
(V) Prevailing interest rates at the time of the order; and
(VI) Other obligations of the payor spouse.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 91 of 247
Uncertified Printout(c) Orders to maintain security may be modified or terminated pursuant to section
14-10-122.
(7) Maintenance agreements - waiver - unrepresented parties. (a) Either or both of
the parties may agree in writing or orally in court to waive maintenance consistent with the
provisions of section 14-10-112. The parties may also agree to waive maintenance in a
premarital agreement or marital agreement consistent with the provisions of the "Uniform
Premarital and Marital Agreements Act", created in part 3 of article 2 of this title. The
enforceability of maintenance provisions in a premarital agreement or marital agreement is
determined pursuant to the provisions of section 14-2-309.
(b) In any proceeding that falls within the maintenance guidelines set forth in subsection
(3) of this section, at the time of either temporary orders or permanent orders, if either party is
not represented by an attorney, the court shall not approve an agreement waiving maintenance or
agreeing to an amount or term of maintenance that does not follow the maintenance guidelines
unless the unrepresented party has indicated that he or she is aware of the maintenance
guidelines pursuant to this section.

except that such earnings or gains shall not be included as income unless a party takes a
distribution from the account. If a party may take a distribution from the account without being
subject to a federal tax penalty for early distribution and the party chooses not to take a
distribution, the court may consider the distribution that could have been taken in determining
the party's gross income.
(III) (A) For income from self-employment, rent, royalties, proprietorship of a business,

a child under the age of thirty months for whom the parties owe a joint legal responsibility or for
an incarcerated parent sentenced to one year or more.

received by a party pursuant to a preexisting court order is taxable income to that party for
federal income tax purposes, then the actual amount of alimony or maintenance received is
included in that party's gross income. If the alimony or maintenance received by a party pursuant
to a preexisting court order is not taxable income to that party for federal income tax purposes,
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 94 of 247
Uncertified Printoutthen the amount of alimony or maintenance that is included in that party's gross income is the
amount of alimony or maintenance received multiplied by 1.25.

Editor's note: For purposes of subsection (3)(b), the uppermost limits of the schedule of
basic child support obligations were changed by House Bill 13-1209 from an annual combined
adjusted gross income of $240,000 to an annual combined adjusted gross income of $360,000,
effective January 1, 2014. (See § 14-10-115 (7).)
14-10-115. Child support guidelines - purpose - determination of income - schedule
of basic child support obligations - adjustments to basic child support - additional
guidelines - child support commission - definitions. (1) Purpose and applicability. (a) The
child support guidelines and schedule of basic child support obligations have the following
purposes:
(I) To establish as state policy an adequate standard of support for children, subject to
the ability of parents to pay;
(II) To make awards more equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of persons in
similar circumstances; and
(III) To improve the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and giving
courts and the parties guidance in establishing levels of awards.
(b) The child support guidelines and schedule of basic child support obligations do the
following:
(I) Calculate child support based upon the parents' combined adjusted gross income
estimated to have been allocated to the child if the parents and children were living in an intact
household;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 95 of 247
Uncertified Printout(II) Adjust the child support based upon the needs of the children for extraordinary
medical expenses and work-related child care costs; and
(III) Allocate the amount of child support to be paid by each parent based upon physical
care arrangements.
(c) This section shall apply to all child support obligations, established or modified, as a
part of any proceeding, including, but not limited to, articles 5, 6, and 10 of this title and articles
4 and 6 of title 19, C.R.S., regardless of when filed.
(2) Duty of support - factors to consider. (a) In a proceeding for dissolution of
marriage, legal separation, maintenance, or child support, the court may order either or both
parents owing a duty of support to a child of the marriage to pay an amount reasonable or
necessary for the child's support and may order an amount determined to be reasonable under the
circumstances for a time period that occurred after the date of the parties' physical separation or
the filing of the petition or service upon the respondent, whichever date is latest, and prior to the
month the child support obligation begins, without regard to marital misconduct.
(b) In determining the amount of support under this subsection (2), the court shall
consider all relevant factors, including:
(I) The financial resources of the child;
(II) The financial resources of the custodial parent;
(III) The standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the marriage not been
dissolved;
(IV) The physical and emotional condition of the child and his or her educational needs;
and
(V) The financial resources and needs of the noncustodial parent.
(3) Definitions. As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) (I) "Adjusted gross income" means gross income, as specified in subsection (5) of
this section, less preexisting child support obligations and less alimony or maintenance actually
paid by a parent, as described in subsection (3)(a)(II) of this section.
(II) For purposes of this subsection (3)(a), if the alimony or maintenance actually paid
by a parent is deductible for federal income tax purposes by that parent, and the alimony or
maintenance is paid and received by the same parties as the child support calculation, then the
actual amount of alimony or maintenance paid by that parent must be deducted from that parent's
gross income. If the alimony or maintenance actually paid by a parent is not deductible for
federal income tax purposes by that parent, then the amount of alimony or maintenance deducted
from that parent's gross income is the amount of alimony or maintenance actually paid by that
parent subject to the following adjustments:
(A) If the combined monthly adjusted gross income of the parties to the maintenance
payment is ten thousand dollars or less, the maintenance actually paid will be multiplied by 1.25;
(B) If the combined monthly adjusted gross income of the parties to the maintenance
payment is more than ten thousand dollars, the maintenance actually paid will be multiplied by
1.33; and
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 96 of 247
Uncertified Printout(C) If the amount of alimony or maintenance actually paid is increased as described in
this section because it is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the multiplier is correct. The presumption may be rebutted with evidence
indicating a different multiplier is more accurate due to the tax implications of the maintenance
payment being different than that reflected by the multiplier.
(III) If a court-ordered alimony or maintenance obligation actually paid by a party does
not involve the same parties as the child support calculation and is not deductible for federal
income tax purposes by that party, then the amount of the court-ordered alimony or maintenance
that is deducted from that party's gross income is the amount actually paid by that party
multiplied by 1.25.
(b) "Combined gross income" means the combined monthly adjusted gross incomes of
both parents.
(c) "Income" means the actual gross income of a parent, if employed to full capacity, or
potential income, if unemployed or underemployed. Gross income of each parent shall be
determined according to subsection (5) of this section.
(c.5) "Mandatory school fees" means fees charged by a school or school district,
including a charter school, for a child attending public primary or secondary school for activities
that are directly related to the educational mission of the school, including but not limited to
laboratory fees; book or educational material fees; school computer or automation-related fees,
whether paid to the school directly or purchased by a parent; testing fees; and supply or material
fees paid to the school. "Mandatory school fees" does not include uniforms, meals, or
extracurricular activity fees.
(d) "Number of children due support", as used in the schedule of basic child support
obligations specified in subsection (7) of this section, means children for whom the parents share
joint legal responsibility and for whom support is being sought.
(e) "Other children" means children who are not the subject of the child support
determination at issue.
(f) "Postsecondary education" includes college and career and technical education
programs.
(g) "Postsecondary education support" means support for the following expenses
associated with attending a college, university, or career and technical education program:
Tuition, books, and fees.
(h) "Shared physical care", for the purposes of the child support guidelines and schedule
of basic child support obligations specified in this section, and as further specified in paragraph
(b) of subsection (8) of this section, means that each parent keeps the children overnight for
more than ninety-two overnights each year and that both parents contribute to the expenses of
the children in addition to the payment of child support.
(i) "Split physical care", for the purposes of the child support guidelines and schedule of
basic child support obligations specified in this section, and as further specified in paragraph (c)
of subsection (8) of this section, means that each parent has physical care of at least one of the
children by means of that child or children residing with that parent the majority of the time.

federal internal revenue service or tips imputed to bring the employee's gross earnings to the
minimum wage for the number of hours worked, whichever is greater;
(C) Commissions;
(D) Payments received as an independent contractor for labor or services, which
payments must be considered income from self-employment;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 98 of 247
Uncertified Printout(E) Bonuses;
(F) Dividends;
(G) Severance pay;
(H) Pensions and retirement benefits, including but not limited to those paid pursuant to
articles 51, 54, 54.5, and 54.6 of title 24, C.R.S., and article 30 of title 31, C.R.S.;
(I) Royalties;
(J) Rents;
(K) Interest;
(L) Trust income;
(M) Annuities;
(N) Capital gains;
(O) Any moneys drawn by a self-employed individual for personal use that are deducted
as a business expense, which moneys must be considered income from self-employment;
(P) Social security benefits, including social security benefits actually received by a
parent as a result of the disability of that parent or as the result of the death of the minor child's
stepparent but not including social security benefits received by a minor child or on behalf of a
minor child as a result of the death or disability of a stepparent of the child;
(Q) Workers' compensation benefits;
(R) Unemployment insurance benefits;
(S) Disability insurance benefits;
(T) Funds held in or payable from any health, accident, disability, or casualty insurance
to the extent that such insurance replaces wages or provides income in lieu of wages;
(U) Monetary gifts;
(V) Monetary prizes, excluding lottery winnings not required by the rules of the
Colorado lottery commission to be paid only at the lottery office;
(W) Income from general partnerships, limited partnerships, closely held corporations,
or limited liability companies. However, if a parent is a passive investor, has a minority interest
in the company, and does not have any managerial duties or input, then the income to be
recognized may be limited to actual cash distributions received.
(X) Expense reimbursements or in-kind payments received by a parent in the course of
employment, self-employment, or operation of a business if they are significant and reduce
personal living expenses;
(Y) Alimony or maintenance received, as adjusted, if applicable, pursuant to subsection
(5)(a)(I.5) of this section; and
(Z) Overtime pay, only if the overtime is required by the employer as a condition of
employment.
(I.5) For purposes of subsection (5)(a)(I)(Y) of this section, if the alimony or
maintenance actually received by a parent is taxable income to that parent for federal income tax
purposes, then the actual amount of alimony or maintenance received is included in that parent's
gross income. If the alimony or maintenance actually received by a parent is not taxable income
to that parent for federal income tax purposes, and the alimony or maintenance is paid and
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 99 of 247
Uncertified Printoutreceived by the same parties as the child support calculation, then the amount of alimony or
maintenance that is included in that parent's gross income is the amount of alimony or
maintenance received by that parent subject to the following adjustments:
(A) If the combined monthly adjusted gross income of the parties to the maintenance
payment is ten thousand dollars or less, the maintenance actually received will be multiplied by
1.25;
(B) If the combined monthly adjusted gross income of the parties to the maintenance
payment is more than ten thousand dollars, the maintenance actually received will be multiplied
by 1.33; and
(C) If the amount of alimony or maintenance actually received is increased as described
in this section because it is not deductible for federal income tax purposes, there is a rebuttable
presumption that the multiplier is correct. The presumption may be rebutted with evidence
indicating a different multiplier is more accurate due to the tax implications of the maintenance
payment being different than that reflected by the multiplier.
(II) "Gross income" does not include:
(A) Child support payments received;
(B) Benefits received from means-tested public assistance programs, including but not
limited to assistance provided under the Colorado works program, as described in part 7 of
article 2 of title 26, C.R.S., supplemental security income, food stamps, and general assistance;
(C) Income from additional jobs that result in the employment of more than forty hours
per week or more than what would otherwise be considered to be full-time employment;
(D) Social security benefits received by the minor children, or on behalf of the minor
children, as a result of the death or disability of a stepparent are not to be included as income for
the minor children for the determination of child support; and
(E) Earnings or gains on a retirement account, including an IRA, which earnings or gains
must not be included as income unless or until a parent takes a distribution from the account. If a
distribution from a retirement account may be taken without being subject to an IRS penalty for
early distribution and the parent decides not to take the distribution, the court may consider the
distribution that could have been taken in determining the parent's gross income if the parent is
not otherwise employed full-time and the retirement account was not received pursuant to the
division of marital property.
(III) (A) For income from self-employment, rent, royalties, proprietorship of a business,
or joint ownership of a partnership or closely held corporation, "gross income" equals gross
receipts minus ordinary and necessary expenses, as defined in sub-subparagraph (B) of this
subparagraph (III), required to produce such income.
(B) "Ordinary and necessary expenses" does not include amounts allowable by the
internal revenue service for the accelerated component of depreciation expenses or investment
tax credits or any other business expenses determined by the court to be inappropriate for
determining gross income for purposes of calculating child support.
(IV) If a preexisting court-ordered alimony or maintenance obligation actually received
by a party does not involve the same parties as the child support calculation and is not deductible
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 100 of 247
Uncertified Printoutfor federal income tax purposes by that party, then the amount of preexisting court-ordered
alimony or maintenance that is deducted from that party's gross income is the amount actually
received by that party multiplied by 1.25.
(b) (I) If a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed, child support must be
calculated based on a determination of potential income; except that a determination of potential
income must not be made for:
(A) A parent who is physically or mentally incapacitated;
(B) A parent who is caring for a child under the age of twenty-four months for whom the
parents owe a joint legal responsibility; or
(C) An incarcerated parent sentenced to one hundred eighty days or more.
(I.5) If the court or delegate child support enforcement unit imputes income pursuant to
this subsection (5), the provisions of subsection (5)(b.5) of this section apply.
(II) If a noncustodial parent who owes past-due child support is unemployed and not
incapacitated and has an obligation of support to a child receiving assistance pursuant to part 7
of article 2 of title 26, C.R.S., the court or delegate child support enforcement unit may order the
parent to pay such support in accordance with a plan approved by the court or to participate in
work activities. Work activities may include one or more of the following:
(A) Private or public sector employment;
(B) Job search activities;
(C) Community service;
(D) Vocational training; or
(E) Any other employment-related activities available to that particular individual.
(III) For the purposes of this section, a parent is not deemed "underemployed" if:
(A) The employment is temporary and is reasonably intended to result in higher income
within the foreseeable future; or
(B) The employment is a good faith career choice that is not intended to deprive a child
of support and does not unreasonably reduce the support available to a child; or
(C) The parent is enrolled full-time in an educational or vocational program or is
employed part-time while enrolled in a part-time educational or vocational program, based on
the institution's enrollment definitions, and the program is reasonably intended to result in a
degree or certification within a reasonable period of time; completing the program will result in a
higher income; the program is a good faith career choice that is not intended to deprive the child
of support; and the parent's participation in the program does not unreasonably reduce the
amount of child support available to a child.
(b.5) (I) Except as otherwise provided in this section, if the court or delegate child
support enforcement unit determines that a parent is voluntarily unemployed or underemployed
or employment information is unreliable, the court or delegate child support enforcement unit
shall determine and document, for the record, the parent's potential income.
(II) In determining potential income, the court or delegate child support enforcement
unit shall consider, to the extent known, the specific circumstances of the parent, including
consideration of the following information, when available:
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 101 of 247
Uncertified Printout(A) The parent's assets;
(B) Residence;
(C) Employment and earnings history;
(D) Job skills;
(E) Educational attainment;
(F) Literacy;
(G) Age;
(H) Health;
(I) Criminal record;
(J) Other employment barriers;
(K) Record of seeking work;
(L) The local job market;
(M) The availability of employers hiring in the community, without changing existing
law regarding the burden of proof;
(N) Prevailing earnings level in the local community. The typical hours available to
workers in the parent's job sector as established by any reliable source generally used and relied
on by the public or persons in a particular occupation, including, but not limited to, verified
statements, work history, the United States department of labor's bureau of labor statistics or
other reliable compilations, the department of labor and employment, or other information
provided by the parent. In the absence of any such information, the court or delegate child
support enforcement unit shall determine the parent's income based on a reasonable rate of pay
for a thirty-two-hour workweek for fifty weeks each year, subject to other factors set forth in this
section that may affect the number of hours the parent is capable of working, such as age, health,
or the specific needs of the subject child.
(O) Transportation; and
(P) Other relevant background factors in the case.
(c) Income statements of the parents shall be verified with documentation of both current
and past earnings. Suitable documentation of current earnings includes pay stubs, employer
statements, or receipts and expenses if self-employed. Documentation of current earnings shall
be supplemented with copies of the most recent tax return to provide verification of earnings
over a longer period. A copy of wage statements or other wage information obtained from the
computer database maintained by the department of labor and employment shall be admissible
into evidence for purposes of determining income under this subsection (5).
(6) Adjustments to gross income. (a) At the time a child support order is initially
established, or in any proceeding to modify a child support order, if a parent is also legally
responsible for the support of any other children for whom the parents do not share joint legal
responsibility, the court shall make an adjustment to the parent's gross income prior to
calculating the basic child support obligation for the child or children who are the subject of the
support order in question as follows:
(I) If a parent is obligated to pay support for another child pursuant to an order, the
amount actually paid on the order must be deducted from that parent's gross income;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 102 of 247
Uncertified Printout(II) If the other child is residing in the home of a parent, the court shall deduct from that
parent's gross income the amount calculated pursuant to paragraph (b) of this subsection (6);
(III) If another child of a parent is residing outside the home of that parent, the court
shall deduct from that parent's gross income the amount of documented money payments
actually paid by the parent for the support of the other child, not to exceed the schedule of basic
support obligations set forth in subsection (7) of this section.
(b) The amount of the adjustment must not exceed the schedule of basic support
obligations listed in this section. For a parent with gross income of less than one thousand five
hundred dollars, the adjustment is seventy-five percent of the amount listed under the schedule
of basic child support obligations in subsection (7)(b) of this section that would represent a child
support obligation based only upon the responsible parent's income, without any other
adjustments for the number of children for whom the parent is responsible. For a parent with
gross income of one thousand five hundred dollars or more per month, the adjustment is
seventy-five percent of the amount listed under the schedule of basic child support obligations in
subsection (7)(b) of this section that would represent a child support obligation based only upon
the responsible parent's income, without any other adjustments for the number of other children
for whom the parent is responsible. The amount calculated as set forth in this subsection (6)(b)
must be subtracted from the amount of the parent's gross income prior to calculating the basic
child support obligation based upon both parents' gross income, as provided in subsection (7) of
this section.
(7) Schedule of basic child support obligations. (a) (I) The basic child support
obligation shall be determined using the schedule of basic child support obligations contained in
paragraph (b) of this subsection (7). The basic child support obligation shall be divided between
the parents in proportion to their adjusted gross incomes.
(II) (A) For combined gross income that falls between amounts shown in the schedule of
basic child support obligations, basic child support amounts shall be interpolated. The category
entitled "number of children due support" in the schedule of basic child support obligations shall
have the meaning defined in subsection (3) of this section.
(B) In circumstances in which the obligor's monthly adjusted gross income is less than
one thousand five hundred dollars but more than six hundred fifty dollars, the obligor is required
to pay a child support payment of fifty dollars per month for one child, seventy dollars per
month for two children, ninety dollars per month for three children, one hundred ten dollars per
month for four children, one hundred thirty dollars per month for five children, and one hundred
fifty dollars per month for six or more children. The minimum order amount shall not apply
when each parent keeps the children more than ninety-two overnights each year as defined in
subsection (3)(h) of this section. In no case, however, shall the amount of child support ordered
to be paid exceed the amount of child support that would otherwise be ordered to be paid if the
parents did not share physical custody.
(C) For an obligor with an adjusted gross income that is less than or equal to one
thousand five hundred dollars but more than six hundred fifty dollars, the obligor's child support
amount, as determined pursuant to subsection (7)(a)(II)(B) of this section, must be adjusted
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 103 of 247
Uncertified Printoutpursuant to subsection (11)(c)(III) of this section. The obligor's child support amount may be
further adjusted to include a share of the work-related and education-related child care costs,
health insurance, extraordinary medical expenses, and other extraordinary adjustments as
described in subsections (9), (10), (11)(a), and (11)(b) of this section. However, if at the time the
child support obligation is calculated, adjustments made pursuant to subsections (9), (10),
(11)(a), and (11)(b) of this section, together with the low-income adjustment amount, exceed
twenty percent of the obligor's adjusted gross income, the child support obligation must be
capped at twenty percent of the obligor's adjusted gross income. The low-income adjustment
does not apply when each parent keeps the children more than ninety-two overnights each year
as defined in subsection (8) of this section. In no case, however, shall the amount of child
support ordered to be paid exceed the amount of child support that would otherwise be ordered
to be paid if the parents did not share physical custody.
(D) In any circumstance in which the obligor's monthly adjusted gross income is less
than or equal to six hundred fifty dollars, regardless of the monthly adjusted gross income of the
obligee, the obligor must be ordered to pay the minimum monthly order amount in child support.
The minimum order amount is ten dollars per month, regardless of the number of children
between these parties. The ten-dollar minimum monthly order amount is not adjusted by the
number of the obligor's overnights with children.
(E) The judge may use discretion to determine child support in circumstances where
combined adjusted gross income exceeds the uppermost levels of the schedule of basic child
support obligations; except that the presumptive basic child support obligation shall not be less
than it would be based on the highest level of adjusted gross income set forth in the schedule of
basic child support obligations.
(b) Schedule of basic child support obligations:
Insert PDF file -- 2019 -- 2nd version effective July 1, 2020 -- Contact pub team for WP file
(8) Computation of basic child support - shared physical care - split physical care -
stipulations - deviations - basis for periodic updates. (a) Except in cases of shared physical
care or split physical care as defined in paragraphs (h) and (i) of subsection (3) of this section, a
total child support obligation is determined by adding each parent's respective basic child
support obligation, as determined through the guidelines and schedule of basic child support
obligations specified in subsection (7) of this section, work-related net child care costs,
extraordinary medical expenses, and extraordinary adjustments to the schedule of basic child
support obligations. The parent receiving a child support payment shall be presumed to spend his
or her total child support obligation directly on the children. The parent paying child support to
the other parent shall owe his or her total child support obligation as child support to the other
parent minus any ordered payments included in the calculations made directly on behalf of the
children for work-related net child care costs, extraordinary medical expenses, or extraordinary
adjustments to the schedule of basic child support obligations.
(b) Because shared physical care presumes that certain basic expenses for the children
will be duplicated, an adjustment for shared physical care is made by multiplying the basic child
support obligation by one and fifty hundredths (1.50). In cases of shared physical care, each
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 104 of 247
Uncertified Printoutparent's adjusted basic child support obligation obtained by application of paragraph (b) of
subsection (7) of this section shall first be divided between the parents in proportion to their
respective adjusted gross incomes. Each parent's share of the adjusted basic child support
obligation shall then be multiplied by the percentage of time the children spend with the other
parent to determine the theoretical basic child support obligation owed to the other parent. To
these amounts shall be added each parent's proportionate share of work-related net child care
costs, extraordinary medical expenses, and extraordinary adjustments to the schedule of basic
child support obligations. The parent owing the greater amount of child support shall owe the
difference between the two amounts as a child support order minus any ordered direct payments
made on behalf of the children for work-related net child care costs, extraordinary medical
expenses, or extraordinary adjustments to the schedule of basic child support obligations. In no
case, however, shall the amount of child support ordered to be paid exceed the amount of child
support that would otherwise be ordered to be paid if the parents did not share physical custody.
(c) (I) In cases of split physical care, a child support obligation shall be computed
separately for each parent based upon the number of children living with the other parent in
accordance with subsections (7), (9), (10), and (11) of this section. The amount so determined
shall be a theoretical support obligation due each parent for support of the child or children for
whom he or she has primary physical custody. The obligations so determined shall then be
offset, with the parent owing the larger amount owing the difference between the two amounts as
a child support order.
(II) If the parents also share physical care as outlined in paragraph (b) of this subsection
(8), an additional adjustment for shared physical care shall be made as provided in paragraph (b)
of this subsection (8).
(d) Stipulations presented to the court shall be reviewed by the court for approval. No
hearing shall be required; however, the court shall use the guidelines and schedule of basic child
support obligations to review the adequacy of child support orders negotiated by the parties as
well as the financial affidavit that fully discloses the financial status of the parties as required for
use of the guidelines and schedule of basic child support obligations.
(e) In an action to establish or modify child support, whether temporary or permanent,
the guidelines and schedule of basic child support obligations set forth in subsection (7) of this
section shall be used as a rebuttable presumption for the establishment or modification of the
amount of child support. A court may deviate from the guidelines and schedule of basic child
support obligations where its application would be inequitable, unjust, or inappropriate. Any
such deviation shall be accompanied by written or oral findings by the court specifying the
reasons for the deviation and the presumed amount under the guidelines and schedule of basic
child support obligations without a deviation. These reasons may include, but are not limited to,
instances where one of the parents spends substantially more time with the child than is reflected
by a straight calculation of overnights, the extraordinary medical expenses incurred for treatment
of either parent or a current spouse, extraordinary costs associated with parenting time, the gross
disparity in income between the parents, the ownership by a parent of a substantial nonincome
producing asset, consistent overtime not considered in gross income under sub-subparagraph (C)
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 105 of 247
Uncertified Printoutof subparagraph (II) of paragraph (a) of subsection (5) of this section, or income from
employment that is in addition to a full-time job or that results in the employment of the obligor
more than forty hours per week or more than what would otherwise be considered to be full-time
employment. The existence of a factor enumerated in this section does not require the court to
deviate from the guidelines and basic schedule of child support obligations but may be a factor
to be considered in the decision to deviate. The court may deviate from the guidelines and basic
schedule of child support obligations even if a factor enumerated in this section does not exist.
(f) The guidelines and schedule of basic child support obligations may be used by the
parties as the basis for periodic updates of child support obligations.
(g) For purposes of calculating child support, when two or more children are included in
the child support worksheet calculation and the parties have a different number of overnights
with two or more of the children, the number of overnights used to determine child support is
determined by adding together the number of overnights for each child and then dividing that
number by the number of children included in the child support worksheet calculation.
(9) Adjustments for child care costs. (a) Net child care costs incurred on behalf of the
children due to employment or job search or the education of either parent shall be added to the
basic obligation and shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their adjusted gross
incomes.
(b) Child care costs shall not exceed the level required to provide quality care from a
licensed source for the children. The value of the federal income tax credit for child care shall be
subtracted from actual costs to arrive at a figure for net child care costs.
(10) Adjustments for health-care expenditures for children. (a) In orders issued
pursuant to this section, the court shall also provide for the child's or children's current and future
medical needs by ordering either parent or both parents to initiate medical or medical and dental
insurance coverage for the child or children through currently effective medical or medical and
dental insurance policies held by the parent or parents, purchase medical or medical and dental
insurance for the child or children, or provide the child or children with current and future
medical needs through some other manner. If a parent has been directed to provide insurance
pursuant to this section and that parent's spouse provides the insurance for the benefit of the
child or children either directly or through employment, a credit on the child support worksheet
shall be given to the parent in the same manner as if the premium were paid by the parent. At the
same time, the court shall order payment of medical insurance or medical and dental insurance
deductibles and copayments.
(a.5) If a child is covered by insurance, the parent securing the coverage, the employer
providing the coverage, or the insurance provider shall provide, upon request by the policy
holder or by court order, the insurance provider's name, the insurance provider's telephone
number, the group and policy number, and the claim address to the non-policy holder. The
information must be provided unless otherwise ordered by the court for good cause shown. This
subsection (10) authorizes the release of information to the other party or parties. After notice to
the party or parties of this obligation, the court has the authority to fine the parent securing
coverage for failure to provide the required information.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 106 of 247
Uncertified Printout(b) The payment of a premium to provide health insurance coverage on behalf of the
children subject to the order shall be added to the basic child support obligation and shall be
divided between the parents in proportion to their adjusted gross income.
(c) The amount to be added to the basic child support obligation shall be the actual
amount of the total insurance premium that is attributable to the child who is the subject of the
order. If this amount is not available or cannot be verified, the total cost of the premium should
be divided by the total number of persons covered by the policy. The cost per person derived
from this calculation shall be multiplied by the number of children who are the subject of the
order and who are covered under the policy. This amount shall be added to the basic child
support obligation and shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their adjusted gross
incomes.
(d) After the total child support obligation is calculated and divided between the parents
in proportion to their adjusted gross incomes, the amount calculated in paragraph (c) of this
subsection (10) shall be deducted from the obligor's share of the total child support obligation if
the obligor is actually paying the premium. If the obligee is actually paying the premium, no
further adjustment is necessary.
(e) Prior to allowing the health insurance adjustment, the parent requesting the
adjustment must submit proof that the child or children have been enrolled in a health insurance
plan and must submit proof of the cost of the premium. Any parent providing insurance coverage
for the child pursuant to this section must notify the other party or parties and the delegate child
support enforcement unit of any change or discontinuation of coverage as soon as practicable,
but no later than fourteen days after the change.
(f) If a parent who is ordered by the court to provide medical or medical and dental
insurance for the child or children has insurance that excludes coverage of the child or children
because the child or children reside outside the geographic area covered by the insurance policy,
the court shall order separate coverage for the child or children if the court determines coverage
is available at a reasonable cost.
(g) Where the application of the premium payment on the guidelines and schedule of
basic child support obligations results in a child support order of fifty dollars or less, or the
premium payment is five percent or more of the parent's gross income, the court or delegate
child support enforcement unit may elect not to require the parent to include the child or children
on an existing policy or to purchase insurance. The parent is, however, required to provide
insurance when it becomes available at a reasonable cost.
(h) (I) Any extraordinary medical expenses incurred on behalf of the children shall be
added to the basic child support obligation and shall be divided between the parents in
proportion to their adjusted gross incomes.
(II) Extraordinary medical expenses are uninsured expenses, including copayments and
deductible amounts, in excess of two hundred fifty dollars per child per calendar year.
Extraordinary medical expenses include, but need not be limited to, such reasonable costs as are
reasonably necessary for orthodontia, dental treatment, asthma treatments, physical therapy,
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 107 of 247
Uncertified Printoutvision care, professional counseling or psychiatric therapy for behavioral or mental health
disorders, and any uninsured chronic health problem.
(III) (A) The party seeking reimbursement for an uninsured medical expense must
provide proof of the expense to the reimbursing party within a reasonable time after incurring the
expense. Absent extraordinary circumstances, failure to provide proof of the expense to the
reimbursing party by July 1 of the year following the calendar year in which the expense was
incurred results in a waiver of the reimbursement.
(B) The party seeking reimbursement may file a motion for judgment of uninsured
medical expenses for that particular calendar year if the party fails to respond and reimburse the
expenses or reach a payment arrangement with the requesting party within forty-nine days after
the date the request was received. The motion must specify the amount of the expense incurred,
the amount sought from the other party pursuant to subsection (10)(h)(I) of this section, and
when and how the request for reimbursement was made to the other party. Any response to the
motion must include any objection to the costs requested or proposed payment arrangements.
(11) Extraordinary adjustments to the schedule of basic child support obligations -
periodic disability benefits. (a) By agreement of the parties or by order of court, the following
reasonable and necessary expenses incurred on behalf of the child must be divided between the
parents in proportion to their adjusted gross income:
(I) Any expenses for attending any special or private elementary or secondary schools to
meet the particular educational needs of the child or public school mandatory school fees; and
(II) Any expenses for transportation of the child, or the child and an accompanying
parent if the child is less than twelve years of age, between the homes of the parents.
(b) Any additional factors that actually diminish the basic needs of the child may be
considered for deductions from the basic child support obligation.
(c) (I) If the noncustodial parent receives periodic disability benefits granted by the
federal "Old-age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Act", 42 U.S.C. sec. 401 et seq., due to the
disability of the noncustodial parent or receives employer-paid retirement benefits from the
federal government due to the retirement of the noncustodial parent, the noncustodial parent
shall notify the custodial party, and the delegate child support enforcement unit, if a party to the
case, within sixty days after the noncustodial party receives notice of such benefits.
(II) Absent good cause shown, the custodial parent must apply for dependent benefits for
the child or children within sixty days after the custodial parent receives notification pursuant to
subsection (11)(c)(I) of this section, and shall cooperate with the appropriate federal agency in
completing any application for benefits.
(III) In cases where the custodial parent receives periodic disability benefits granted by
the federal "Old-age, Survivors, and Disability Insurance Act", 42 U.S.C. sec. 401 et seq., on
behalf of dependent children due to the disability of the noncustodial parent or receives
employer-paid retirement benefits from the federal government on behalf of dependent children
due to the retirement of the noncustodial parent, the noncustodial parent's share of the total child
support obligation as determined pursuant to subsection (8) of this section must be reduced in an
amount equal to the amount of the benefits.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 108 of 247
Uncertified Printout(d) In cases where the custodial parent receives a lump sum retroactive award for
benefits granted by the federal old-age, survivors, or disability insurance benefits program, 42
U.S.C. sec. 7, on behalf of a dependent child due to the disability of the noncustodial parent, or
receives a lump sum retroactive award for employer-paid retirement benefits from the federal
government on behalf of a dependent child due to the retirement of the noncustodial parent, the
lump sum award received by the custodial parent must be credited against any retroactive
support judgment or any past-due child support obligation, regardless of whether the past-due
obligation has been reduced to judgment owed by the noncustodial parent. This credit must not
be given against any amounts owed by the noncustodial parent for debt as defined in section
14-14-104 or for any retroactive support or any arrearage that accrued prior to the date of
eligibility for disability or retirement benefits as determined by the social security
administration. Any lump sum retirement or disability payments due to the retirement or
disability of the noncustodial parent, received by the custodial parent as a result of the retirement
or disability of the noncustodial parent, paid for a period of time that precedes the date of such
benefit date eligibility, or any amount in excess of the established child support order or
judgment, must be deemed a gratuity to the child.
(12) Dependency exemptions. Unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, the court
shall allocate the right to claim dependent children for income tax purposes between the parties.
These rights shall be allocated between the parties in proportion to their contributions to the
costs of raising the children. A parent shall not be entitled to claim a child as a dependent if he or
she has not paid all court-ordered child support for that tax year or if claiming the child as a
dependent would not result in any tax benefit.
(13) Emancipation. (a) For child support orders entered on or after July 1, 1997, unless
a court finds that a child is otherwise emancipated, emancipation occurs and child support
terminates without either party filing a motion when the last or only child attains nineteen years
of age unless one or more of the following conditions exist:
(I) The parties agree otherwise in a written stipulation after July 1, 1997;
(II) If the child is mentally or physically disabled, the court or the delegate child support
enforcement unit may order child support, including payments for medical expenses or insurance
or both, to continue beyond the age of nineteen;
(III) If the child is still in high school or an equivalent program, support continues until
the end of the month following graduation. A child who ceases to attend high school prior to
graduation and later reenrolls is entitled to support upon reenrollment and until the end of the
month following graduation, but not beyond age twenty-one.
(IV) If the child marries, the child shall be considered emancipated as of the date of the
marriage. If the marriage is annulled, dissolved, or declared invalid, child support may be
reinstated.
(V) If the child enters into active military duty, the child shall be considered
emancipated.
(b) Nothing in paragraph (a) of this subsection (13) or subsection (15) of this section
shall preclude the parties from agreeing in a written stipulation or agreement on or after July 1,
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 109 of 247
Uncertified Printout1997, to continue child support beyond the age of nineteen or to provide for postsecondary
education expenses for a child and to set forth the details of the payment of the expenses. If the
stipulation or agreement is approved by the court and made part of a decree of dissolution of
marriage or legal separation, the terms of the agreement shall be enforced as provided in section
14-10-112.
(14) Advisement to parties - annual exchange of information. (a) When a child
support order is entered or modified, unless otherwise ordered by the court, the parties shall
exchange information relevant to child support calculations on changes that have occurred since
the previous child support order, and other appropriate information once a year or less often, for
the purpose of updating and modifying the order without a court hearing. The parties shall use
the approved standardized child support forms specified in subsection (4) of this section in
exchanging financial information. The parents shall include the forms with any agreed
modification or an agreement that a modification is not appropriate at the time. If the agreed
amount departs from the guidelines and schedule of basic child support obligations, the parties
shall furnish statements of explanation with the forms and shall file the documents with the
court. The court shall review the agreement pursuant to this paragraph (a) and inform the parties
by regular mail whether or not additional or corrected information is needed, or that the
modification is granted, or that the modification is denied. If the parties cannot agree, a
modification pursuant to this paragraph (a) shall not be entered; however, either party may move
for or the court may schedule, upon its own motion, a modification hearing.
(b) Upon request of the noncustodial parent, the court may order the custodial parent to
submit an annual update of financial information using the approved standardized child support
forms, as specified in subsection (4) of this section, including information on the actual expenses
relating to the children of the marriage for whom support has been ordered. The court shall not
order the custodial parent to update the financial information pursuant to this paragraph (b) in
circumstances where the noncustodial parent has failed to exercise parenting time rights or when
child support payments are in arrears or where there is documented evidence of domestic
violence, child abuse, or a violation of a protection order on the part of the noncustodial parent.
The court may order the noncustodial parent to pay the costs involved in preparing an update to
the financial information. If the noncustodial parent claims, based upon the information in the
updated form, that the custodial parent is not spending the child support for the benefit of the
children, the court may refer the parties to a mediator to resolve the differences. If there are costs
for such mediation, the court shall order that the party requesting the mediation pay such costs.
(c) [Editor's note: Subsection (14)(c) is effective July 1, 2024.] In any status conference,
administrative conference, or hearing in which child support is at issue, the court or the delegate
child support unit shall verbally advise the parties that failure to pay child support ordered by the
court or as a result of an administrative process action may result in enforcement actions and the
addition of interest on arrears and that an agreement to modify child support is not effective until
approved by the court, or delegate child support unit for administrative orders, and entered as an
order.

Uncertified Printout(15) Postsecondary education. (a) This subsection (15) shall apply to all child support
obligations established or modified as a part of any proceeding, including but not limited to
articles 5, 6, and 10 of this title and articles 4 and 6 of title 19, C.R.S., prior to July 1, 1997. This
subsection (15) shall not apply to child support orders established on or after July 1, 1997, which
shall be governed by paragraph (a) of subsection (13) of this section.
(b) For child support orders entered prior to July 1, 1997, unless a court finds that a child
is otherwise emancipated, emancipation occurs and child support terminates without either party
filing a motion when the last or only child attains nineteen years of age unless one or more of the
following conditions exist:
(I) The parties agree otherwise in a written stipulation after July 1, 1991;
(II) If the child is mentally or physically disabled, the court or the delegate child support
enforcement unit may order child support, including payments for medical expenses or insurance
or both, to continue beyond the age of nineteen;
(III) If the child is still in high school or an equivalent program, support continues until
the end of the month following graduation, unless there is an order for postsecondary education,
in which case support continues through postsecondary education as provided in this subsection
(15). A child who ceases to attend high school prior to graduation and later reenrolls is entitled
to support upon reenrollment and until the end of the month following graduation, but not
beyond age twenty-one.
(IV) If the child marries, the child shall be considered emancipated as of the date of the
marriage. If the marriage is annulled, dissolved, or declared invalid, child support may be
reinstated.
(V) If the child enters into active military duty, the child shall be considered
emancipated.
(c) If the court finds that it is appropriate for the parents to contribute to the costs of a
program of postsecondary education, then the court shall terminate child support and enter an
order requiring both parents to contribute a sum determined to be reasonable for the education
expenses of the child, taking into account the resources of each parent and the child. In
determining the amount of each parent's contribution to the costs of a program of postsecondary
education for a child, the court shall be limited to an amount not to exceed the amount listed
under the schedule of basic child support obligations in paragraph (b) of subsection (7) of this
section for the number of children receiving postsecondary education. If such an order is entered,
the parents shall contribute to the total sum determined by the court in proportion to their
adjusted gross incomes as defined in paragraph (a) of subsection (3) of this section. The amount
of contribution that each parent is ordered to pay pursuant to this subsection (15) shall be
subtracted from the amount of each parent's gross income, respectively, prior to calculating the
basic child support obligation for any remaining children pursuant to subsection (7) of this
section.
(d) In no case shall the court issue orders providing for both child support and
postsecondary education to be paid for the same time period for the same child regardless of the
age of the child.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 111 of 247
Uncertified Printout(e) Either parent or the child may move for an order at any time before the child attains
the age of twenty-one years. The order for postsecondary education support may not extend
beyond the earlier of the child's twenty-first birthday or the completion of an undergraduate
degree.
(f) Either a child seeking an order for postsecondary education expenses or on whose
behalf postsecondary education expenses are sought, or the parent from whom the payment of
postsecondary education expenses are sought, may request that the court order the child and the
parent to seek mediation prior to a hearing on the issue of postsecondary education expenses.
Mediation services shall be provided in accordance with section 13-22-305, C.R.S. The court
may order the parties to seek mediation if the court finds that mediation is appropriate.
(g) The court may order the support paid directly to the educational institution, to the
child, or in such other fashion as is appropriate to support the education of the child.
(h) A child shall not be considered emancipated solely by reason of living away from
home while in postsecondary education. If the child resides in the home of one parent while
attending school or during periods of time in excess of thirty days when school is not in session,
the court may order payments from one parent to the other for room and board until the child
attains the age of nineteen.
(i) If the court orders support pursuant to this subsection (15), the court or delegate child
support enforcement unit may also order that the parents provide health insurance for the child or
pay medical expenses of the child or both for the duration of the order. The order shall provide
that these expenses be paid in proportion to their adjusted gross incomes as defined in subsection
(3) of this section. The court or delegate child support enforcement unit shall order a parent to
provide health insurance if the child is eligible for coverage as a dependent on that parent's
insurance policy or if health insurance coverage for the child is available at reasonable cost.
(j) An order for postsecondary education expenses entered between July 1, 1991, and
July 1, 1997, may be modified pursuant to this subsection (15) to provide for postsecondary
education expenses subject to the statutory provisions for determining the amount of a parent's
contribution to the costs of postsecondary education, the limitations on the amount of a parent's
contribution, and the changes to the definition of postsecondary education consistent with this
section as it existed on July 1, 1994. An order for child support entered prior to July 1, 1997, that
does not provide for postsecondary education expenses shall not be modified pursuant to this
subsection (15).
(k) Postsecondary education support may be established or modified in the same manner
as child support under this article.
(16) Child support commission. (a) The child support guidelines, including the
schedule of basic child support obligations, and general child support issues must be reviewed at
least once every four years by a child support commission, which commission is hereby created.
After the periodic review described in this section, the commission shall submit a report to the
governor and to the general assembly explaining the commission's recommendations.
(b) As part of its review, the commission shall consider economic data on the cost of
raising children and analyze case data on the application of, and deviations from, the guidelines
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 112 of 247
Uncertified Printoutand the schedule of basic child support obligations to be used in the commission's review to
ensure that deviations from the guidelines and schedule of basic child support obligations are
limited. Further, as part of its review, the commission shall consider:
(I) Establishing an adequate standard of support for children, subject to the parents'
ability to pay;
(II) Making awards more equitable by ensuring more consistent treatment of persons in
similar circumstances; and
(III) Improving the efficiency of the court process by promoting settlements and giving
courts and the parties guidance on establishing levels of awards.
(c) (I) The child support commission consists of no more than twenty-one members. The
commission is dedicated to including diverse perspectives in its recommendations.
(II) The governor shall appoint up to nineteen persons to the commission, who must
include:
(A) Representatives of the judiciary and the Colorado bar association;
(B) The director of the division in the state department of human services, who is
responsible for child support services, or the director's designee;
(C) A director of a county department of human or social services;
(D) The child support liaison to the judicial department;
(E) Interested parties;
(F) A certified public accountant; and
(G) At least four parent representatives, at least two of whom are present or past obligors
and two of whom are present or past obligees.
(III) In making appointments to the commission, the governor shall attempt to assure
racial, economic, gender, and geographical diversity.
(IV) The remaining two members of the commission are a member of the house of
representatives appointed by the speaker of the house of representatives and a member of the
senate appointed by the president of the senate and must not be members of the same political
party.
(d) Members of the child support commission shall be reimbursed for actual and
necessary expenses for travel and mileage incurred in connection with their duties. The child
support commission is authorized, subject to appropriation, to incur expenses related to its work,
including the costs associated with public hearings, printing, travel, and research.

14-10-116. Appointment in domestic relations cases - representation of the best
interests of the child - legal representative of the child - disclosure - short title. (1) The
court may, upon the motion of either party or upon its own motion, appoint an attorney, in good
standing and licensed to practice law in the state of Colorado, to serve as the legal representative
of the child, representing the best interests of the child in any domestic relations proceeding that
involves allocation of parental responsibilities. In no instance may the same person serve as both
the child's legal representative pursuant to this section and as the child and family investigator
for the court pursuant to section 14-10-116.5. Within seven days after the appointment, the
appointed person shall comply with the disclosure provisions of subsection (2.5) of this section.
(2) (a) The legal representative of the child, appointed pursuant to subsection (1) of this
section, shall represent the best interests of the minor or dependent child, as described in section
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 115 of 247
Uncertified Printout14-10-124, with respect to the parenting time, the allocation of parental responsibilities, financial
support for the child, the child's property, or any other issue related to the child that is identified
by the legal representative of the child or the appointing court. The legal representative of the
child shall actively participate in all aspects of the case involving the child, within the bounds of
the law. The legal representative of the child shall comply with the provisions set forth in the
Colorado rules of professional conduct and any applicable provisions set forth in chief justice
directives or other practice standards established by rule or directive of the chief justice pursuant
to section 13-91-105 (1)(c) concerning the duties or responsibilities of best interest
representation in legal matters affecting children, including training requirements related to
domestic violence and its effect on children, adults, and families. The legal representative of the
child shall not be called as a witness in the case. While the legal representative of the child shall
ascertain and consider the wishes of the child, the legal representative of the child is not required
to adopt the child's wishes in the legal representative of the child's recommendation or advocacy
for the child unless such wishes serve the best interests of the child, as described in section
14-10-124.
(b) The short title of this subsection (2) is "Julie's Law".
(2.5) (a) Within seven days after his or her appointment, the appointed person shall
disclose to each party, attorneys of record, and the court any familial, financial, or social
relationship that the appointed person has or has had with the child, either party, the attorneys of
record, or the judicial officer and, if a relationship exists, the nature of the relationship.
(b) Based on the disclosure required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (2.5),
the court may, in its discretion, terminate the appointment and appoint a different person in the
proceedings. A party has seven days from the date of the disclosure to object to the appointment
based upon information contained in the disclosure. If a party objects to the appointment, the
court shall appoint a different person or confirm the appointment within seven days after the date
of the party's objection. If no party timely objects to the appointment, then the appointment is
deemed confirmed.
(3) (a) The court shall enter an order for costs, fees, and disbursements in favor of the
child's legal representative appointed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. The order shall
be made against any or all of the parties; except that, if the responsible parties are determined to
be indigent, the costs, fees, and disbursements shall be borne by the state.
(b) In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, prior to the entry of a
decree of dissolution or legal separation, the court shall not enter an order requiring the state to
bear the costs, fees, or disbursements related to the appointment of a child's legal representative
unless both parties are determined to be indigent after considering the combined income and
assets of the parties.
(c) If the appointment of a child's legal representative occurs in a case involving
unmarried parties, including those proceedings that occur after the entry of a decree for
dissolution of marriage or of legal separation, the court shall make every reasonable effort to
apportion costs between the parties in a manner that will minimize the costs, fees, and
disbursements that shall be borne by the state.

14-10-116.5. Appointment in domestic relations cases - child and family investigator
- disclosure - background check. (1) The court may, upon the motion of either party or upon
its own motion, appoint a neutral third person to serve the court as a child and family
investigator pursuant to subsection (2) of this section in a domestic relations proceeding that
involves allocation of parental responsibilities. The court shall set forth the specific duties of the
child and family investigator in a written order of appointment. The same person may not serve
as both the legal representative of the child pursuant to section 14-10-116 and as the child and
family investigator for the court pursuant to this section. Within seven days after the
appointment, the appointed person shall comply with the disclosure provisions of subsection
(2.5) of this section.
(2) (a) A child and family investigator appointed by the court from an eligibility roster
established pursuant to chief justice directive may be an attorney, a mental health professional,
or any other individual with appropriate training and qualifications, as set forth in subsection
(2)(f) of this section, and an independent perspective acceptable to the court. The child and
family investigator for the court shall investigate and report as specifically directed by the court
in the appointment order, taking into consideration the relevant factors for determining the best
interests of the child, as described in section 14-10-124. The purpose of the investigation is to
assist in determining the best interests of the child, with the child's safety always paramount.
(b) The child and family investigator shall make independent and informed
recommendations to the court, in the form of a written report with the court, unless otherwise
ordered by the court. While the child and family investigator shall consider the wishes of the
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 117 of 247
Uncertified Printoutchild, the child and family investigator need not adopt such wishes in making his or her
recommendations to the court, unless they serve the best interests of the child, as described in
section 14-10-124. The child's wishes, if expressed, must be disclosed in the child and family
investigator's written report. The court shall consider the entirety of the report, as well as any
testimony by the child and family investigator, the parties, and any other professionals, before
adopting any recommendations made by the child and family investigator.
(c) The child and family investigator may be called to testify as a court-appointed expert
witness regarding the child and family investigator's reports, but only if the court finds that the
child and family investigator has the appropriate training and qualifications set forth in
subsection (2)(f) of this section. Recommendations should be considered in full context of the
report.
(d) In addition to the training requirements and qualifications set forth in subsection
(2)(f) of this section, the child and family investigator shall comply with applicable provisions
set forth in chief justice directives, and any other practice or ethical standards established by
rule, statute, or any licensing board that regulates the child and family investigator. A child and
family investigator shall strive to engage in culturally informed and nondiscriminatory practices.
(e) A party wishing to file a complaint related to a person's duties as a child and family
investigator shall file such complaint in accordance with the applicable provisions in chief
justice directives.
(f) The court shall not appoint a person from the eligibility registry to be a child and
family investigator for a case pursuant to this section unless the court finds that the person is
qualified as competent by training and experience in, at a minimum, domestic violence and its
effects on children, adults, and families, child abuse, and child sexual abuse in accordance with
section 14-10-127.5. The person's training and experience must be provided by recognized
sources with expertise in domestic violence and the traumatic effects of domestic violence in
accordance with section 14-10-127.5. As of January 1, 2024, initial and ongoing training must
include, at a minimum:
(I) Ten initial hours of training on domestic violence, including coercive control, and its
traumatic effects on children, adults, and families;
(II) Ten initial hours of training on child abuse and child sexual abuse and its traumatic
effects; and
(III) Fifteen subsequent hours of training every five years on domestic violence,
including coercive control, child abuse, and child sexual abuse, and the traumatic effects on
children, adults, and families.
(2.5) (a) Within seven days after his or her appointment, the appointed person shall
disclose to each party, attorneys of record, and the court any familial, financial, or social
relationship that the appointed person has or has had with the child, either party, the attorneys of
record, or the judicial officer and, if a relationship exists, the nature of the relationship.
(b) Based on the disclosure required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (2.5),
the court may, in its discretion, terminate the appointment and appoint a different person in the
proceedings. A party has seven days from the date of the disclosure to object to the appointment
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 118 of 247
Uncertified Printoutbased upon information contained in the disclosure. If a party objects to the appointment, the
court shall appoint a different person or confirm the appointment within seven days after the date
of the party's objection. If no party timely objects to the appointment, then the appointment is
deemed confirmed.
(3) (a) The court shall enter an order for costs, fees, and disbursements in favor of the
child and family investigator appointed pursuant to subsection (1) of this section. The order must
be made against any or all of the parties; except that, if the responsible parties are determined to
be indigent, the costs, fees, and disbursements are borne by the state.
(b) In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, prior to the entry of a
decree of dissolution or legal separation, the court shall not enter an order requiring the state to
bear the costs, fees, or disbursements related to the appointment of a child and family
investigator unless both parties are determined to be indigent after considering the combined
income and assets of the parties.
(c) If the appointment of a child and family investigator occurs in a case involving
unmarried parties, including those proceedings that occur after the entry of a decree for
dissolution of marriage or of legal separation, the court shall make every reasonable effort to
apportion costs between the parties in a manner that will minimize the costs, fees, and
disbursements that shall be borne by the state.
(4) (a) Prior to being appointed as a child and family investigator, the person shall
submit a complete set of his or her fingerprints to the judicial department for the purposes of a
background check, and the judicial department shall determine based on the background check
whether the person is suitable to act as a child and family investigator. The department shall
forward such fingerprints to the Colorado bureau of investigation for the purpose of conducting a
state and national fingerprint-based criminal history record check utilizing the records of the
Colorado bureau of investigation and the federal bureau of investigation. The department is the
authorized agency to receive information regarding the result of a national fingerprint-based
criminal history record check.
(b) When the results of a fingerprint-based criminal history record check of a person
performed pursuant to this section reveal a record of arrest without a disposition, the department
shall require that applicant to submit to a name-based judicial record check, as defined in section
22-2-119.3 (6)(d). Upon request of the department pursuant to this section, the applicant shall
provide a name-based judicial record check.
(c) The applicant shall pay the cost associated with the background check.

14-10-117. Payment of maintenance or child support. (1) Upon its own motion or
upon motion of either party, the court may at any time order that maintenance or child support
payments be made to the clerk of the court or, if the executive director of the department of
human services has notified the state court administrator that the judicial district issuing the
order is ready to participate in the family support registry pursuant to section 26-13-114 (5),
C.R.S., and, for payments for maintenance obligations, the family support registry is ready to
accept maintenance payments, through the family support registry, as trustee, for remittance to
the person entitled to receive the payments. The court may not order payments to be made to the
clerk of the court once payments may be made through the family support registry. The
payments shall be due on a certain date or dates of each month. If the support payments are
required under this section, title 19, C.R.S., or section 26-13-114 (1), C.R.S., to be made through
the family support registry, the court shall order that payments be made through the registry in
accordance with the procedures specified in section 26-13-114, C.R.S.
(2) The clerk of the court shall maintain records listing the amount of payments, the date
when payments are required to be made, and the names and addresses of the parties affected by
the order for those payments he or she receives through the court registry.
(3) If payments are to be made through the family support registry, the parties affected
by the order shall inform the family support registry, and if payments are to be made through the
court registry, the parties affected by the order shall inform the clerk of the court of any change
of address or of other conditions that may affect the administration of the order.

(7) In cases in which a party is ordered to make payments through the court registry,
upon receipt of a verified notice of a support obligation assigned to the state, the clerk of the
court shall, without further action by the court, pay the support to the county child support
enforcement unit rather than to the obligee. When the state no longer has authorization to receive
any support payments, the county child support enforcement unit shall notify the clerk of the
court to stop sending the support payments to the county and to send the support payments
directly to the obligee.

resources of both parties, may order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other
party of maintaining or defending any proceeding under this article and for attorney's fees,
including sums for legal services rendered and costs incurred prior to the commencement of the
proceeding or after entry of judgment. The court may order that the amount be paid directly to

14-10-120. Decree. (1) A decree of dissolution of marriage or of legal separation is final
when entered, subject to the right of appeal. An appeal from the decree of dissolution that does
not challenge the finding that the marriage is irretrievably broken does not delay the finality of
that provision of the decree which dissolves the marriage beyond the time for appealing from
that provision, so that either of the parties may remarry pending appeal.
(2) No earlier than one hundred eighty-two days after entry of a decree of legal
separation, on motion of either party and proof that a notice has been mailed to the other party at
his or her last-known address, the court shall convert the decree of legal separation to a decree of
dissolution of marriage, and a copy thereof shall be mailed to both parties.
(3) The clerk of the court shall give notice of the entry of a decree of dissolution to the
office of state registrar of vital statistics in the division of administration of the department of
public health and environment, which office shall make this information available to the public
upon request.
(4) No decree that may enter shall relieve a spouse from any obligation imposed by law
as a result of the marriage for the support or maintenance of a spouse determined to be mentally
incompetent by a court of competent jurisdiction prior to the decree, unless such spouse has
sufficient property or means of support.

(6) Notwithstanding the entry of a final decree of dissolution of marriage or of legal
separation pursuant to this section, the district court may maintain jurisdiction to enter such
temporary or permanent civil protection orders as may be provided by law upon request of any
of the parties to the action for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, including, but not
limited to, any protection order requested pursuant to section 14-10-108.

the provisions of this section, at any time after the entry of a decree of dissolution or legal
separation, a party to the action may request restoration of a prior full name.
(2) The requesting party must file a verified motion and affidavit under the same case
number in the district court in which the decree of dissolution or legal separation was entered.
The requesting party's motion and affidavit must include:
(a) The caption and case number for the action in which the decree of dissolution or
legal separation was entered; and
(b) The requesting party's sworn statement that the restoration of a prior full name is not
detrimental to any person.
(3) The court shall enter an order restoring the requesting party's name if the court
determines that:
(a) The court entered a decree of dissolution or legal separation in an action concerning
the requesting party; and
(b) The request to restore a prior full name is not detrimental to any person.
(4) The order restoring a prior full name of the party does not affect any party's rights or
obligations pursuant to the decree of dissolution or legal separation entered in the action.

Uncertified Printout14-10-120.3. Dissolution of marriage or legal separation upon affidavit -
requirements. (1) Final orders in a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation
may be entered upon the affidavit of either or both parties when:
(a) There are no minor children of the husband and wife and the wife is not pregnant or
the husband and wife are both represented by counsel and have entered into a separation
agreement that provides for the allocation of parental responsibilities concerning the children of
the marriage and setting out the amount of child support to be provided by the husband or wife
or both; and
(b) The adverse party is served in the manner provided by the Colorado rules of civil
procedure; and
(c) There is no genuine issue as to any material fact; and
(d) There is no marital property to be divided or the parties have entered into an
agreement for the division of their marital property.
(2) If one party desires to submit the matter for entry of final orders upon an affidavit,
the submitting party shall file his or her affidavit setting forth sworn testimony showing the
court's jurisdiction and factual averments supporting the relief requested in the proceeding
together with a copy of the proposed decree, a copy of any separation agreement proposed for
adoption by the court, and any other supporting evidence. The filing of the affidavit does not
shorten any statutory waiting period required for entry of a decree of dissolution or decree of
legal separation.
(3) The court shall not be bound to enter a decree upon the affidavits of either or both
parties, but the court may, upon its own motion, require that a formal hearing be held to
determine any or all issues presented by the pleadings.

14-10-122. Modification and termination of provisions for maintenance, support,
and property disposition - automatic lien - definitions. (1) (a) Except as otherwise provided
in sections 14-10-112 (6) and 14-10-115 (11)(c), the provisions of any decree respecting
maintenance may be modified only as to installments accruing subsequent to the motion for
modification and only upon a showing of changed circumstances so substantial and continuing
as to make the terms unfair, and, except as otherwise provided in subsection (5) of this section,
the provisions of any decree respecting child support may be modified only as to installments
accruing subsequent to the filing of the motion for modification and only upon a showing of
changed circumstances that are substantial and continuing or on the ground that the order does
not contain a provision regarding medical support, such as insurance coverage, payment for
medical insurance deductibles and copayments, or unreimbursed medical expenses. The trial
court retains continuing jurisdiction to modify a decree respecting maintenance or child support
pursuant to this section during the pendency of an appeal. The court shall not revoke or modify
the provisions as to property disposition unless the court finds the existence of conditions that
justify the reopening of a judgment.

Uncertified Printout(b) Application of the child support guidelines and schedule of basic child support
obligations set forth in section 14-10-115 to the circumstances of the parties at the time of the
filing of a motion for modification of the child support order which results in less than a ten
percent change in the amount of support due per month shall be deemed not to be a substantial
and continuing change of circumstances.
(c) In any action or proceeding in any court of this state in which child support,
maintenance when combined with child support, or maintenance is ordered, a payment becomes
a final money judgment, referred to in this section as a support judgment, when it is due and not
paid. Such payment is not retroactively modified except pursuant to subsection (1)(a) of this
section and may be enforced as other judgments without further action by the court; except that
an existing child support order with respect to child support payable by the obligor may be
modified retroactively to the time that a mutually agreed upon change of physical custody occurs
pursuant to subsection (5) of this section. A support judgment is entitled to full faith and credit
and may be enforced in any court of this state or any other state. In order to enforce a support
judgment, the obligee shall file with the court that issued the order a verified entry of support
judgment specifying the period of time that the support judgment covers and the total amount of
the support judgment for that period. The obligee or the delegate child support enforcement unit
is not required to wait fourteen days to execute on such support judgment. However, a copy of
the verified entry of support judgment must be provided to all parties pursuant to rule 5 of the
Colorado rules of civil procedure, upon filing with the court. A verified entry of support
judgment is not required to be signed by an attorney. A verified entry of support judgment may
be used to enforce a support judgment for debt entered pursuant to section 14-14-104. The filing
of a verified entry of support judgment revives all individual support judgments that have arisen
during the period of time specified in the entry of support judgment and that have not been
satisfied, pursuant to rule 54 (h) of the Colorado rules of civil procedure, without the
requirement of a separate motion, notice, or hearing. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
subsection (1)(c), no court order for support judgment nor verified entry of support judgment is
required in order for the county and state child support enforcement units to certify past-due
amounts of child support to the internal revenue service or to the department of revenue for
purposes of intercepting a federal or state tax refund or lottery winnings.
(d) If maintenance or child support is modified pursuant to this section, the modification
should be effective as of the date of the filing of the motion, unless the court finds that it would
cause undue hardship or substantial injustice or unless there has been a mutually agreed upon
change of physical custody as provided for in subsection (5) of this section. In no instance shall
the order be retroactively modified prior to the date of filing, unless there has been a mutually
agreed upon change of physical custody. The court may modify installments of maintenance or
child support due between the filing of the motion and the entry of the order even if the
circumstances justifying the modification no longer exist at the time the order is entered.
(1.5) (a) Lien by operation of law. (I) Commencing July 1, 1997, all cases in which
services are provided in accordance with Title IV-D of the federal "Social Security Act", as
amended, referred to in this subsection (1.5) as "IV-D cases", shall be subject to the provisions
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 125 of 247
Uncertified Printoutof this subsection (1.5), regardless of the date the order for child support was entered. In any
IV-D case in which current child support, child support when combined with maintenance, or
maintenance has been ordered, a payment becomes a support judgment when it is due and not
paid, and a lien therefor is created by operation of law against the obligor's real and personal
property and any interest in any such real or personal property. The entry of an order for child
support debt, retroactive child support, or child support arrearages or a verified entry of
judgment pursuant to this section creates a lien by operation of law against the obligor's real and
personal property and any interest in any such real and personal property.
(II) The amount of such lien shall be limited to the amount of the support judgment for
outstanding child support, child support when combined with maintenance, maintenance, child
support debt, retroactive child support, or child support arrearages, any interest accrued thereon,
and the amount of any filing fees as specified in this section.
(III) A support judgment or lien shall be entitled to full faith and credit and may be
enforced in any court of this state or any other state. Full faith and credit shall be accorded to
such a lien arising from another state that complies with the provisions of this subsection (1.5).
Judicial notice or hearing or the filing of a verified entry of judgment shall not be required prior
to the enforcement of such a lien.
(IV) The creation of a lien pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any other
remedy allowed by law.
(b) Lien on real property. (I) To evidence a lien on real property created pursuant to
this subsection (1.5), a delegate child support enforcement unit shall issue a notice of lien and
record the same in the real estate records in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in
the state of Colorado in which the obligor holds an interest in real property. From the time of
recording of the notice of lien, such lien shall be an encumbrance in favor of the obligee, or the
assignee of the obligee, and shall encumber any interest of the obligor in any real property in
such county.
(II) The lien on real property created by this section shall remain in effect for the earlier
of twelve years or until all past-due amounts are paid, including any accrued interest and costs,
without the necessity of renewal. A lien on real property arising pursuant to this subsection (1.5)
may be extended or renewed indefinitely beyond twelve years by rerecording the lien every
twelve years. Within twenty calendar days after satisfaction of the debt or debts described in the
notice of lien, the delegate child support enforcement unit shall record a release of lien with the
clerk and recorder of the county where the notice of lien was recorded. A release of lien shall be
conclusive evidence that the lien is extinguished.
(III) The child support enforcement unit shall be exempt from the payment of recording
fees charged by the clerk and recorder for the recording of notices of lien or releases of lien.
(c) Lien on personal property other than wages, insurance claim payments, awards,
and settlements, and money held by a financial institution as defined in 42 U.S.C. sec. 669a
(d)(1) or motor vehicles. (I) To evidence a lien on personal property, other than wages;
insurance claim payments, awards, and settlements as authorized in section 26-13-122.7;
accounts as authorized in section 26-13-122.3; and money held by a financial institution as
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 126 of 247
Uncertified Printoutdefined in 42 U.S.C. sec. 669a (d)(1) or motor vehicles, created pursuant to this subsection (1.5),
the state child support enforcement agency shall file a notice of lien with the secretary of state by
means of direct electronic data transmission. From the time of filing the notice of lien with the
secretary of state, the lien is an encumbrance in favor of the obligee, or the assignee of the
obligee, and encumbers all personal property or any interest of the obligor in any personal
property.
(II) The lien on personal property created by this section shall remain in effect for the
earlier of twelve years or until all past-due amounts are paid, including any accrued interest and
costs, without the necessity of renewal. A lien on personal property arising pursuant to this
subsection (1.5) may be extended or renewed indefinitely beyond twelve years by rerecording
the lien every twelve years. Within twenty calendar days after satisfaction of the debt or debts
described in the notice of lien, the state child support enforcement agency shall file a release of
lien with the secretary of state. The filing of such a release of lien shall be conclusive evidence
that the lien is extinguished.
(III) The state child support enforcement agency shall be exempt from paying a fee for
the filing of notices of liens or releases of liens with the secretary of state pursuant to this
paragraph (c).
(IV) For purposes of this paragraph (c), "personal property" means property that the
child support enforcement agency has determined has a net equity value of not less than five
thousand dollars at the time of the filing of the notice of lien with the secretary of state.
(d) Lien on motor vehicles. (I) (A) To evidence a lien on a motor vehicle created
pursuant to this subsection (1.5), a delegate child support enforcement unit shall issue a notice of
lien to the authorized agent as defined in section 42-6-102 (1.5) by first class mail. From the time
of filing of the lien for public record and the notation of such lien on the owner's certificate of
title, such lien shall be an encumbrance in favor of the obligee, or the assignee of the obligee,
and must encumber any interest of the obligor in the motor vehicle. In order for any such lien to
be effective as a valid lien against a motor vehicle, the obligee, or assignee of the obligee, shall
have such lien filed for public record and noted on the owner's certificate of title in the manner
provided in sections 42-6-121 and 42-6-129.
(B) Liens on motor vehicles created by this section shall remain in effect for the same
period of time as any other lien on motor vehicles as specified in section 42-6-127, C.R.S., or
until the entire amount of the lien is paid, whichever occurs first. A lien created pursuant to this
section may be renewed pursuant to section 42-6-127, C.R.S. Within twenty calendar days after
satisfaction of the debt or debts described in the notice of lien, the delegate child support
enforcement unit shall release the lien pursuant to the procedures specified in section 42-6-125,
C.R.S. When a lien on a motor vehicle created pursuant to this subsection (1.5) is released, the
authorized agent and the executive director of the department of revenue shall proceed as
provided in section 42-6-126, C.R.S.
(C) The child support enforcement unit shall not be exempt from the payment of filing
fees charged by the authorized agent for the filing of either the notice of lien or the release of
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 127 of 247
Uncertified Printoutlien. However, the child support enforcement unit may add the amount of the filing fee to the
lien amount and collect the amount of such fees from the obligor.

vehicle that is designed primarily for travel on the public highways and that is generally and
commonly used to transport persons and property over the public highways, trailers, semitrailers,
and trailer coaches, without motive power; that has a net equity value based upon the loan value
identified for such vehicle in the national automobile dealers' association car guide of not less
than five thousand dollars at the time of the filing of the notice of lien and that meets such
additional conditions as the state board of human services may establish by rule; and on which
vehicle a lien already exists that is filed for public record and noted accordingly on the owner's
certificate of title. "Motor vehicle" does not include low-power scooters, as defined in section
42-1-102, C.R.S.; vehicles that operate only upon rails or tracks laid in place on the ground or
that travel through the air or that derive their motive power from overhead electric lines; farm
tractors, farm trailers, and other machines and tools used in the production, harvesting, and care
of farm products; and special mobile machinery or industrial machinery not designed primarily
for highway transportation. "Motor vehicle" does not include a vehicle that has a net equity value
based upon the loan value identified for such vehicle in the national automobile dealers'
association car guide of less than five thousand dollars at the time of the filing of the notice of
lien and does not include a vehicle that is not otherwise encumbered by a lien or mortgage that is
filed for public record and noted accordingly on the owner's certificate of title.

in effect for the earlier of twelve years or until all past-due amounts are paid and shall have
priority over all unrecorded liens and all subsequent recorded or unrecorded liens from the time
of recording, except such liens as may be exempted by regulation of the state board of human
services. A lien on real property arising pursuant to this subsection (1.5) may be extended or
renewed indefinitely beyond twelve years by rerecording the lien every twelve years.

this subsection (1.5) may be extended or renewed indefinitely beyond twelve years by
rerecording the lien every twelve years.
(III) Liens on motor vehicles created pursuant to this section shall remain in effect for
the same period of time as any other lien on motor vehicles as specified in section 42-6-127,
C.R.S., or until all past-due amounts are paid, whichever occurs first, and shall have priority
from the time the lien is filed for public record and noted on the owner's certificate of title over

subsection (1.5).

provisions for the establishment of a child support order based on a court-ordered, voluntary, or
mutually agreed upon change of physical care may also be entered retroactively to the date when

change of physical care occurs, parties are encouraged to avail themselves of the provision set

Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 130 of 247
Uncertified Printoutcourt hearing. The court shall not modify child support pursuant to this subsection (5) for any
time more than five years prior to the filing of the motion to modify child support, unless the

forth in paragraph (c) of this subsection (6), the individual named as the father in the order may
file a motion to modify or terminate an order for child support entered pursuant to this article if

(b) If the court finds pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (6) that the individual
named as the father in the order is not the biological parent of the child for whose benefit the
child support order was entered and that it is just and proper under the circumstances and in the
best interests of the child, the court shall modify the provisions of the order for support with
respect to that child by terminating the child support obligation as to installments accruing
subsequent to the filing of the motion for modification or termination, and the court may vacate
or deem as satisfied, in whole or in part, unpaid child support obligations arising from or based
upon the order determining parentage. The court shall not order restitution from the state for any
sums paid to or collected by the state for the benefit of the child.

subsection (6) must be filed within two years from the date of the entry of the initial order
establishing the child support obligation.
(II) Repealed.
(d) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this subsection (6), a
court order for child support shall not be modified or terminated pursuant to this subsection (6)

or (1)(e), C.R.S., knowing that he was not the father of the child;
(II) The child was adopted by the child support obligor; or

14-10-123.6. Required notice of prior restraining orders to prevent domestic abuse -
proceedings concerning parental responsibilities relating to a child - resources for family
services. (1) The general assembly hereby finds, determines, and declares that domestic
violence is a pervasive problem in society and that a significant portion of domestic violence in
society occurs in or near the home. The general assembly further recognizes research
demonstrating that children in a home where domestic violence occurs are at greater risk of
emotional, psychological, and physical harm. Studies have found that eighty to ninety percent of
the children living in homes with domestic violence are aware of the violence. The general
assembly finds that emerging research has established that these children are at greater risk of
the following: Psychological, social, and behavioral problems; higher rates of academic
problems; more physical illnesses, particularly stress-associated disorders; and a greater
propensity to exhibit aggressive and violent behavior, sometimes carrying violent and
violence-tolerant roles to their adult relationships. Studies have also noted that children are
affected to varying degrees by witnessing violence in the home, and each child should be
assessed on an independent basis. Accordingly, the general assembly determines that it is in the
best interests of the children of the state of Colorado for the courts to advise the parents or
guardians of children affected by domestic violence about the availability of resources and
services and for such persons to be provided with information concerning the resources and
services available to aid in the positive development of their children. It is the intent of the
general assembly that such information would increase the awareness of the possible effects of
domestic violence on children in the home, while providing the parents and legal guardians of
these children with a comprehensive resource of available children's services as well as potential
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 136 of 247
Uncertified Printoutfinancial resources to assist parents and legal guardians seeking to retain services for their
children affected by domestic violence.
(2) When filing a proceeding concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities
relating to a child pursuant to this article, the filing party shall have a duty to disclose to the
court the existence of any prior temporary or permanent restraining orders to prevent domestic
abuse issued pursuant to article 14 of title 13, C.R.S., and any emergency protection orders
issued pursuant to section 13-14-103, C.R.S., entered against either party by any court within
two years prior to the filing of the proceeding. The disclosure required pursuant to this section
shall address the subject matter of the previous restraining orders or emergency protection
orders, including the case number and jurisdiction issuing such orders.
(3) After the filing of the petition, the court shall advise the parties concerning domestic
violence services and potential financial resources that may be available and shall strongly
encourage the parties to obtain such services for their children, in appropriate cases. If the
parties' children participate in such services, the court shall apportion the costs of such services
between the parties as it deems appropriate.
(4) The parties to a domestic relations petition filed pursuant to this article shall receive
information concerning domestic violence services and potential financial resources that may be
available.

14-10-123.7. Parental education - legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly
recognizes research that documents the negative impact divorce and separation can have on
children when the parents continue the marital conflict, expose the children to this conflict, or
place the children in the middle of the conflict or when one parent drops out of the child's life.
This research establishes that children of divorce or separation may exhibit a decreased ability to
function academically, socially, and psychologically because of the stress of the divorce or
separation process. The general assembly also finds that, by understanding the process of divorce
and its impact on both adults and children, parents can more effectively help and support their
children during this time of family reconfiguration. Accordingly, the general assembly finds that
it is in the best interests of children to authorize courts to establish, or contract with providers for
the establishment of, educational programs for separating, divorcing, and divorced parents with
minor children. The intent of these programs is to educate parents about the divorce process and
its impact on adults and children and to teach coparenting skills and strategies so that parents
may continue to parent their children in a cooperative manner.
(2) A court may order a parent whose child is under eighteen years of age to attend a
program designed to provide education concerning the impact of separation and divorce on
children in cases in which the parent of a minor is a named party in a dissolution of marriage
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 137 of 247
Uncertified Printoutproceeding, a legal separation proceeding, a proceeding concerning the allocation of parental
responsibilities, parenting time proceedings, or postdecree proceedings involving the allocation
of parental responsibilities or parenting time or proceedings in which the parent is the subject of
a protection order issued pursuant to this article.
(3) Each judicial district, or combination of judicial districts as designated by the chief
justice of the Colorado supreme court, may establish an educational program for divorcing and
separating parents who are parties to any of the types of proceedings specified in subsection (2)
of this section or arrange for the provision of such educational programs by private providers
through competitively negotiated contracts. The educational program shall inform parents about
the divorce process and its impact on adults and children and shall teach parents coparenting
skills and strategies so that they may continue to parent their children in a cooperative manner.
Any such educational program shall be administered and monitored by the implementing judicial
district or districts and shall be paid for by the participating parents in accordance with each
parent's ability to pay.

14-10-124. Best interests of the child. (1) Legislative declaration. While co-parenting
is not appropriate in all circumstances following dissolution of marriage or legal separation, the
general assembly finds and declares that, in most circumstances, it is in the best interest of all
parties to encourage frequent and continuing contact between each parent and the minor children
of the marriage after the parents have separated or dissolved their marriage. In order to effectuate
this goal when appropriate, the general assembly urges parents to share the rights and
responsibilities of child-rearing and to encourage the love, affection, and contact between the
children and the parents.
(1.3) Definitions. For purposes of this section and section 14-10-129 (2)(c), unless the
context otherwise requires:
(a) "Domestic violence" means an act of violence or a threatened act of violence upon a
person with whom the actor is or has been involved in an intimate relationship, and may include
any act or threatened act against a person or against property, including an animal, when used as
a method of coercion, control, punishment, intimidation, or revenge directed against a person
with whom the actor is or has been involved in an intimate relationship.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 138 of 247
Uncertified Printout(b) "Intimate relationship" means a relationship between spouses, former spouses, past
or present unmarried couples, or persons who are both parents of the same child regardless of
whether the persons have been married or have lived together at any time.
(c) "Sexual assault" has the same meaning as set forth in section 19-1-103.
(1.5) Allocation of parental responsibilities. The court shall determine the allocation of
parental responsibilities, including parenting time and decision-making responsibilities, in
accordance with the best interests of the child giving paramount consideration to the child's
safety and the physical, mental, and emotional conditions and needs of the child as follows:
(a) Determination of parenting time. The court, upon the motion of either party or
upon its own motion, may make provisions for parenting time that the court finds are in the best
interests of the child, with the child's safety always paramount, unless the court finds, after a
hearing, that parenting time by the party would endanger the child's physical health or
significantly impair the child's emotional development. In addition to a finding that parenting
time would endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair the child's emotional
development, in any order imposing or continuing a parenting time restriction, the court shall
enumerate the specific factual findings supporting the restriction, including findings related to
domestic violence, child abuse, and child sexual abuse, and may enumerate the conditions that
the restricted party could fulfill in order to seek modification in the parenting plan. When a claim
of child abuse or neglect, domestic violence, or sexual assault where there is also a claim that the
child was conceived as a result of the sexual assault has been made to the court, or the court has
reason to believe that a party has committed child abuse or neglect, domestic violence, or sexual
assault where there is also a claim that the child was conceived as a result of the sexual assault,
prior to determining parenting time, the court shall follow the provisions of subsection (4) of this
section. In determining the best interests of the child for purposes of parenting time, the court
shall consider all relevant factors, including:
(I) The wishes of the child's parents as to parenting time;
(II) The wishes of the child if he or she is sufficiently mature to express reasoned and
independent preferences as to the parenting time schedule;
(III) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her parents, his or her
siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests;
(III.5) Any report related to domestic violence that is submitted to the court by a child
and family investigator, if one is appointed pursuant to section 14-10-116.5; a professional
parental responsibilities evaluator, if one is appointed pursuant to section 14-10-127; or a legal
representative of the child, if one is appointed pursuant to section 14-10-116. The court may
consider other testimony regarding domestic violence from the parties, experts, therapists for any
parent or child, the department of human services, parenting time supervisors, school personnel,
or other lay witnesses.
(IV) The child's adjustment to his or her home, school, and community;
(V) The mental and physical health of all individuals involved, except that a disability
alone shall not be a basis to deny or restrict parenting time;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 139 of 247
Uncertified Printout(VI) The ability of the parties to encourage the sharing of love, affection, and contact
between the child and the other party; except that, if the court determines that a party is acting to
protect the child from witnessing domestic violence or from being a victim of child abuse or
neglect or domestic violence, the party's protective actions shall not be considered with respect
to this factor;
(VII) Whether the past pattern of involvement of the parties with the child reflects a
system of values, time commitment, and mutual support;
(VIII) The physical proximity of the parties to each other as this relates to the practical
considerations of parenting time;
(IX) and (X) Repealed.
(XI) The ability of each party to place the needs of the child ahead of his or her own
needs.
(b) Allocation of decision-making responsibility. The court, upon the motion of either
party or its own motion, shall allocate the decision-making responsibilities between the parties
based upon the best interests of the child. In determining decision-making responsibility, the
court may allocate the decision-making responsibility with respect to each issue affecting the
child mutually between both parties or individually to one or the other party or any combination
thereof. When a claim of child abuse or neglect or domestic violence has been made to the court,
or the court has reason to believe that a party has committed child abuse or neglect, domestic
violence, or sexual assault where there is also a claim that the child in question was conceived as
a result of the sexual assault, prior to allocating decision-making responsibility, the court shall
follow the provisions of subsection (4) of this section. In determining the best interests of the
child for purposes of allocating decision-making responsibilities, the court shall consider, in
addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (a) of this subsection (1.5), all relevant factors
including:
(I) Credible evidence of the ability of the parties to cooperate and to make decisions
jointly;
(II) Whether the past pattern of involvement of the parties with the child reflects a
system of values, time commitment, and mutual support that would indicate an ability as mutual
decision makers to provide a positive and nourishing relationship with the child;
(III) Whether an allocation of mutual decision-making responsibility on any one or a
number of issues will promote more frequent or continuing contact between the child and each
of the parties.
(IV) and (V) Repealed.
(1.7) Pursuant to section 14-10-123.4, children have the right to have the determination
of matters relating to parental responsibilities based upon the best interests of the child. In
contested hearings on final orders regarding the allocation of parental responsibilities, the court
shall make findings on the record concerning the factors the court considered and the reasons
why the allocation of parental responsibilities is in the best interests of the child.
(2) The court shall not consider conduct of a party that does not affect that party's
relationship to the child.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 140 of 247
Uncertified Printout(3) In determining parenting time or decision-making responsibilities, the court shall not
presume that any person is better able to serve the best interests of the child because of that
person's sex.
(3.5) A request by either party for genetic testing shall not prejudice the requesting party
in the allocation of parental responsibilities pursuant to subsection (1.5) of this section.
(4) (a) When a claim of child abuse or neglect, domestic violence, or sexual assault
where there is also a claim that the child was conceived as a result of the sexual assault has been
made to the court, or the court has reason to believe that a party has committed child abuse or
neglect, domestic violence, or sexual assault that resulted in the conception of the child, prior to
allocating parental responsibilities, including parenting time and decision-making responsibility,
and prior to considering the factors set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (1.5) of this
section, the court shall consider the following factors:
(I) Whether one of the parties has committed an act of child abuse or neglect as defined
in section 18-6-401, C.R.S., or as defined under the law of any state, which factor must be
supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the court finds that one of the parties has
committed child abuse or neglect, then it shall not be in the best interests of the child to allocate
mutual decision-making with respect to any issue over the objection of the other party or the
legal representative of the child.
(II) Whether one of the parties has committed an act of domestic violence, has engaged
in a pattern of domestic violence, or has a history of domestic violence, which factor must be
supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If the court finds by a preponderance of the
evidence that one of the parties has committed domestic violence:
(A) It shall not be in the best interests of the child to allocate mutual decision-making
responsibility over the objection of the other party or the legal representative of the child, unless
the court finds that there is credible evidence of the ability of the parties to make decisions
cooperatively in the best interest of the child in a manner that is safe for the abused party and the
child; and
(B) The court shall not appoint a parenting coordinator solely to ensure that mutual
decision-making can be accomplished.
(III) Whether one of the parties has committed an act of sexual assault resulting in the
conception of the child, which factor must be supported by a preponderance of the evidence. If
the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that one of the parties has committed sexual
assault and the child was conceived as a result of the sexual assault, there is a rebuttable
presumption that it is not in the best interests of the child to allocate sole or split
decision-making authority to the party found to have committed sexual assault or to allocate
mutual decision-making between a party found to have committed sexual assault and the party
who was sexually assaulted with respect to any issue.
(IV) If one of the parties is found by a preponderance of the evidence to have committed
sexual assault resulting in the conception of the child, whether it is in the best interests of the
child to prohibit or limit the parenting time of that party with the child.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 141 of 247
Uncertified Printout(b) The court shall consider the additional factors set forth in paragraphs (a) and (b) of
subsection (1.5) of this section in light of any finding of child abuse or neglect, domestic
violence, or sexual assault resulting in the conception of a child pursuant to this subsection (4).
(c) If a party is absent or leaves home because of an act or threatened act of domestic
violence committed by the other party, such absence or leaving shall not be a factor in
determining the best interests of the child.
(d) When the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that one of the parties has
committed child abuse or neglect, domestic violence, or sexual assault resulting in the
conception of the child, the court shall consider, as the primary concern, the safety and
well-being of the child and the abused party.
(e) When the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that one of the parties has
committed child abuse or neglect, domestic violence, or sexual assault resulting in the
conception of the child, in formulating or approving a parenting plan, the court shall consider
conditions on parenting time that ensure the safety of the child and of the abused party. In
addition to any provisions set forth in subsection (7) of this section that are appropriate, the
parenting plan in these cases may include, but is not limited to, the following provisions:
(I) An order limiting contact between the parties to contact that the court deems is safe
and that minimizes unnecessary communication between the parties;
(II) An order that requires the exchange of the child for parenting time to occur in a
protected setting determined by the court;
(III) An order for supervised parenting time;
(IV) An order restricting overnight parenting time;
(V) An order that restricts the party who has committed domestic violence, sexual
assault resulting in the conception of the child, or child abuse or neglect from possessing or
consuming alcohol or controlled substances during parenting time or for twenty-four hours prior
to the commencement of parenting time;
(VI) An order directing that the address of the child or of any party remain confidential;
(VII) An order that imposes any other condition on one or more parties that the court
determines is necessary to protect the child, another party, or any other family or household
member of a party; and
(VIII) An order that requires child support payments to be made through the child
support registry to avoid the need for any related contact between the parties and an order that
the payments be treated as a nondisclosure of information case.
(f) When the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that one of the parties has
committed domestic violence, the court may order the party to submit to a domestic violence
evaluation. If the court determines, based upon the results of the evaluation, that treatment is
appropriate, the court may order the party to participate in domestic violence treatment. At any
time, the court may require a subsequent evaluation to determine whether additional treatment is
necessary. If the court awards parenting time to a party who has been ordered to participate in
domestic violence treatment, the court may order the party to obtain a report from the treatment
provider concerning the party's progress in treatment and addressing any ongoing safety
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 142 of 247
Uncertified Printoutconcerns regarding the party's parenting time. The court may order the party who has committed
domestic violence to pay the costs of the domestic violence evaluations and treatment.
(5) Repealed.
(6) In the event of a medical emergency, either party shall be allowed to obtain
necessary medical treatment for the minor child or children without being in violation of the
order allocating decision-making responsibility or in contempt of court.
(7) In order to implement an order allocating parental responsibilities, both parties may
submit a parenting plan or plans for the court's approval that shall address both parenting time
and the allocation of decision-making responsibilities. If no parenting plan is submitted or if the
court does not approve a submitted parenting plan, the court, on its own motion, shall formulate
a parenting plan that shall address parenting time and the allocation of decision-making
responsibilities. When issues relating to parenting time are contested, and in other cases where
appropriate, the parenting plan must be as specific as possible to clearly address the needs of the
family as well as the current and future needs of the aging child. In general, the parenting plan
may include, but is not limited to, the following provisions:
(a) A designation of the type of decision-making awarded;
(b) A practical schedule of parenting time for the child, including holidays and school
vacations;
(c) A procedure for the exchanges of the child for parenting time, including the location
of the exchanges and the party or parties responsible for the child's transportation;
(d) A procedure for communicating with each other about the child, including methods
for communicating and frequency of communication;
(e) A procedure for communication between a parent and the child outside of that
parent's parenting time, including methods for communicating and frequency of communication;
and
(f) Any other orders in the best interests of the child.
(8) The court may order mediation, pursuant to section 13-22-311, C.R.S., to assist the
parties in formulating or modifying a parenting plan or in implementing a parenting plan
specified in subsection (7) of this section and may allocate the cost of said mediation between
the parties.

14-10-124.4. Family time for grandparents or great-grandparents - legislative
declaration - definitions. (1) (a) The general assembly finds and declares that:
(I) A close relationship between grandparents or great-grandparents and grandchildren or
great-grandchildren can be beneficial for the health and well-being of grandchildren or
great-grandchildren; and
(II) Grandparents or great-grandparents may provide acceptance, patience, love,
stability, wisdom, and support to grandchildren or great-grandchildren.
(b) The general assembly further finds that it may be in the best interests of
grandchildren or great-grandchildren for grandparents or great-grandparents to be granted
grandparent or great-grandparent family time because of the positive effects the relationship may
have on a grandchild's or great-grandchild's health and well-being.
(2) As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) "Grandparent" means a person who is the parent of a child's father or mother, who is
related to the child by blood, in whole or by half, adoption, or marriage; except that
"grandparent" does not include the parent of a child's legal father or mother whose parental
rights have been terminated in accordance with sections 19-5-101 and 19-1-104 (1)(d).
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 144 of 247
Uncertified Printout(b) "Great-grandparent" means a person who is the grandparent of a child's father or
mother, who is related to the child by blood, in whole or by half, adoption, or marriage; except
that "great-grandparent" does not include the grandparent of a child's legal father or mother
whose parental rights have been terminated in accordance with sections 19-5-101 and 19-1-104
(1)(d).
(c) "Grandparent or great-grandparent family time" or "grandparent family time" means
any form of contact or engagement between grandparents or great-grandparents and their
grandchildren or great-grandchildren for the purposes of preserving and strengthening family
ties.
(3) Any grandparent or great-grandparent of a child may, in the manner set forth in this
section, seek a court order granting reasonable grandparent family time with a grandchild or
great-grandchild when there is or has been a child custody case or a case concerning the
allocation of parental responsibilities with respect to that child. Because cases arise that do not
directly deal with child custody or the allocation of parental responsibilities but nonetheless have
an impact on the custody of, or parental responsibilities with respect to a child, for the purposes
of this section, a "case concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities with respect to a
child" includes any of the following, whether or not child custody was or parental
responsibilities were specifically an issue:
(a) The marriage of the child's parents has been declared invalid or has been dissolved
by a court or a court has entered a decree of legal separation with regard to such marriage;
(b) Legal custody of or parental responsibilities with respect to the child have been given
or allocated to a party other than the child's parent or the child has been placed outside of and
does not reside in the home of the child's parent, excluding any child who has been placed for
adoption or whose adoption has been legally finalized; or
(c) The child's parent, who is the child of the grandparent or grandchild of the
great-grandparent, has died.
(4) A party seeking a grandparent family time order shall submit, together with the
party's petition for grandparent family time, to the district court for the district in which the child
resides, an affidavit setting forth facts supporting the requested order and shall give notice,
together with a copy of the party's affidavit, to each party involved in the allocation of parental
responsibilities proceedings as determined by a court pursuant to this article 10. The party with
legal custody or parental responsibilities as determined by a court pursuant to this article 10, may
file opposing affidavits. If neither party requests a hearing, the court shall enter an order granting
grandparent family time to the petitioning grandparent or great-grandparent only upon a finding
that the grandparent family time is in the best interests of the child. A hearing must be held if
either party so requests or if it appears to the court that it is in the best interests of the child that a
hearing be held. At the hearing, parties submitting affidavits are allowed an opportunity to be
heard. If, at the conclusion of the hearing, the court finds it is in the best interests of the child to
grant grandparent family time to the petitioning grandparent or great-grandparent, the court shall
enter an order granting grandparent family time. In determining the best interests of the child for
the purpose of grandparent or great-grandparent family time, the court shall presume the parental
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 145 of 247
Uncertified Printoutdetermination regarding grandparent time is in the best interests of the child. A grandparent or
great-grandparent may overcome the presumption upon a showing by clear and convincing
evidence that the grandparent family time is in the child's best interests. In making this
determination, the court shall consider the factors described in section 14-10-124 (1.5)(a).
(5) The court may appoint a legal representative of a child pursuant to section 14-10-116
to represent the best interests of the child in a proceeding pursuant to subsection (4) of this
section.
(6) A grandparent or great-grandparent shall not file a petition seeking an order granting
grandparent family time more than once every two years absent a showing of good cause. If the
court finds there is good cause to file more than one such petition, it shall allow such additional
petition to be filed and shall consider it. The court may order reasonable attorney fees to the
prevailing party. The court may not make any order restricting the movement of the child if such
restriction is solely for the purpose of allowing the grandparent or great-grandparent the
opportunity to exercise the grandparent's or great-grandparent's family time with the grandchild
or great-grandchild.
(7) The court may establish, modify, or terminate grandparent family time if the order
would serve the best interests of the child.
(8) An order establishing, granting, or denying parenting time rights to the parent of a
child does not affect grandparent family time granted to a grandparent or great-grandparent as
long as the grandparent family time is in the best interests of the child pursuant to this section.

14-10-124.5. Disputes concerning grandparent or great-grandparent family time. (1)
Upon a verified motion by a grandparent or great-grandparent who has been granted grandparent
or great-grandparent family time or upon the court's own motion alleging that the person with
legal custody or parental responsibilities of the child as determined by a court pursuant to this
article 10 with whom grandparent family time has been granted is not complying with a
grandparent or great-grandparent family time order or schedule, the court shall determine from
the verified motion, and response to the motion, if any, whether there has been or is likely to be a
substantial and continuing noncompliance with the grandparent or great-grandparent family time
order or schedule and either:
(a) Deny the motion, if there is an inadequate allegation; or
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 146 of 247
Uncertified Printout(b) Set the matter for hearing with notice to the grandparent or great-grandparent and the
person with legal custody or parental responsibilities of the child as determined by the court of
the time and place of the hearing; or
(c) Require said parties to seek mediation and report back to the court on the results of
the mediation within sixty days. Mediation services must be provided in accordance with section
13-22-305. At the end of the mediation period, the court may approve an agreement reached by
the parties or shall set the matter for hearing.
(2) After the hearing, if a court finds that the person with legal custody or parental
responsibilities of the child as determined by the court has not complied with the grandparent or
great-grandparent family time order or schedule and has violated the court order, the court, in the
best interests of the child, may issue orders which may include but need not be limited to:
(a) Imposing additional terms and conditions which are consistent with the court's
previous order;
(b) Modifying the previous order to meet the best interests of the child;
(c) Requiring the violator to post bond or security to insure future compliance;
(d) Requiring that makeup grandparent or great-grandparent family time be provided for
the aggrieved grandparent or great-grandparent and child under the following conditions:
(I) That such grandparent or great-grandparent family time is of the same type and
duration of grandparent or great-grandparent family time as that which was denied, including but
not limited to grandparent or great-grandparent family time during weekends, on holidays, and
on weekdays and during the summer;
(II) That such grandparent or great-grandparent family time is made up within one year
after the noncompliance occurs; or
(III) That such grandparent or great-grandparent family time is in the manner chosen by
the aggrieved grandparent or great-grandparent if it is in the best interests of the child;
(e) Finding the person who did not comply with the grandparent or great-grandparent
family time schedule in contempt of court and imposing a fine or jail sentence; and
(f) Awarding to the aggrieved party, when appropriate, actual expenses, including
attorney fees, court costs, and expenses incurred by a grandparent or great-grandparent because
of the other person's failure to provide or exercise court-ordered grandparent or
great-grandparent family time. Nothing in this section precludes a party's right to a separate and
independent legal action in tort.
(3) As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) "Grandparent" has the same meaning as set forth in section 14-10-124.4.
(b) "Great-grandparent" has the same meaning as set forth in section 14-10-124.4.
(c) "Grandparent or great-grandparent family time" or "grandparent family time" has the
same meaning as set forth in section 14-10-124.4.

14-10-125. Temporary orders. (1) A party to a proceeding concerning the allocation of
parental responsibilities may move for a temporary order. The court may allocate temporary
parental responsibilities, including temporary parenting time and temporary decision-making
responsibility, after a hearing.
(2) If a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation is dismissed, any
temporary order concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities is vacated unless a parent
or the person allocated parental responsibilities moves that the proceeding continue as a
proceeding concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities and the court finds, after a
hearing, that the circumstances of the parents and the best interests of the child require that a
decree concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities be issued.
(3) If a proceeding concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities commenced in
the absence of a petition for dissolution of marriage or legal separation is dismissed, any
temporary order concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities is vacated.

shall be made part of the record in the case.
(2) The court may seek the advice of professional personnel whether or not they are
employed on a regular basis by the court. The advice given shall be in writing and shall be made
available by the court to counsel of record, parties, and other expert witnesses upon request, but
it shall otherwise be considered confidential and shall be sealed and shall not be open to
inspection, except by consent of the court. Counsel may call for cross-examination any
professional personnel consulted by the court.

14-10-127. Evaluation and reports - training and qualifications of evaluators -
disclosure. (1) (a) (I) (A) In all proceedings concerning the allocation of parental
responsibilities with respect to a child, the court may, upon motion of either party or upon its
own motion, order any county or district department of human or social services or a licensed
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 148 of 247
Uncertified Printoutmental health professional qualified pursuant to subsection (4) of this section and referred to in
this section as an "evaluator" to perform an evaluation and file a written report concerning the
disputed issues relating to the allocation of parental responsibilities for the child, unless the
motion by either party is made for the purpose of delaying the proceedings. The purpose of the
evaluation and report is to assist in determining the best interests of the child, with the child's
safety always paramount. The evaluation and subsequent report must focus on the best interests
of the child and the factors set forth in sections 14-10-124 and 14-10-129 in any post-decree or
relocation case. In addition, the evaluator shall assess a party's parenting attributes as those
attributes relate to the best interests of the child, and consider any psychological needs of the
child when making recommendations concerning decision-making and parenting time.
(B) Any court or any personnel of a county or district department of human or social
services appointed by the court to do an evaluation pursuant to this section must be qualified
pursuant to subsection (4) of this section and be selected from an eligibility roster established
pursuant to applicable chief justice directive.
(C) When a mental health professional performs the evaluation, the court shall appoint
or approve the selection of the mental health professional as the evaluator. Within seven days
after the appointment, the evaluator shall comply with the disclosure provisions of subsection
(1.2) of this section. The court shall, at the time of the evaluator's appointment, order one or
more of the parties to deposit a reasonable sum with the court to pay the cost of the evaluation.
The court may order the reasonable charge for the evaluation and report to be assessed as costs
between the parties at the time the evaluation is completed.
(I.3) In determining whether to order an evaluation pursuant to this section, in addition
to any other considerations the court deems relevant, the court shall consider:
(A) Whether an investigation by a child and family investigator pursuant to section
14-10-116.5 would be sufficient or appropriate given the scope or nature of the disputed issues
relating to the allocation of parental responsibilities for the child;
(B) Whether an evaluation pursuant to this section is necessary to assist the court in
determining the best interests of the child; and
(C) Whether involving the child in an evaluation pursuant to this section is in the best
interests of the child.
(I.5) A party may request a supplemental evaluation to the evaluation ordered pursuant
to subsection (1)(a)(I) of this section. The court shall appoint another qualified evaluator to
perform the supplemental evaluation at the initial expense of the moving party. The evaluator
appointed to perform the supplemental evaluation shall comply with the disclosure provisions of
subsection (1.2) of this section. The court shall not order a supplemental evaluation if it
determines that any of the following applies, based on motion and supporting affidavits:
(A) Such motion is interposed for purposes of delay;
(B) A party objects, and the party who objects or the child has a physical or mental
condition that would make it harmful for such party or the child to participate in the
supplemental evaluation;
(C) The purpose of such motion is to harass or oppress the other party;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 149 of 247
Uncertified Printout(D) The moving party has failed or refused to cooperate with the first evaluation;
(E) The weight of the evidence other than the evaluation concerning the allocation of
parental responsibilities or parenting time by the mental health professional demonstrates that a
second evaluation would not be of benefit to the court in determining the allocation of parental
responsibilities and parenting time; or
(F) In addition to the evaluation ordered pursuant to subparagraph (I) of this paragraph
(a), there has been an investigation and report prepared by a child and family investigator
pursuant to section 14-10-116.5, and the court finds that a supplemental evaluation concerning
parental responsibilities will not serve the best interests of the child.
(II) Each party and the child, if possible, shall cooperate in the supplemental evaluation.
If the court finds that the supplemental evaluation was necessary and materially assisted the
court, the court may order the costs of such supplemental evaluation to be assessed as costs
between the parties. Except as otherwise provided in this section, the report is confidential and is
not available for public inspection unless by order of court. The cost of each department of
human services evaluation is based on an ability to pay and must be assessed as part of the costs
of the action or proceeding, and, upon receipt of such sum by the clerk of court, the clerk of
court shall transmit the money to the department or agency performing the evaluation.
(b) The person signing a report or evaluation and supervising its preparation must be a
licensed mental health professional. The licensed mental health professional signing a report or
evaluation must be qualified as competent, by training and experience, as described in subsection
(4) of this section. Unlicensed associates or other persons may work with the mental health
professional to prepare the report.
(c) An evaluator shall strive to engage in culturally informed and nondiscriminatory
practices, and strive to avoid conflicts of interest or multiple relationships in conducting
evaluations.
(1.2) (a) Within seven days after his or her appointment, the evaluator shall disclose to
each party, attorneys of record, and the court any familial, financial, or social relationship that
the evaluator has or has had with the child, either party, the attorneys of record, or the judicial
officer and, if a relationship exists, the nature of the relationship.
(b) Based on the disclosure required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (1.2),
the court may, in its discretion, terminate the appointment and appoint a different evaluator in
the proceedings. A party has seven days from the date of the disclosure to object to the
appointment based upon information contained in the disclosure. If a party objects to the
appointment, the court shall appoint a different person or confirm the appointment within seven
days after the date of the party's objection. If no party timely objects to the appointment, then the
appointment is deemed confirmed.
(2) In preparing the report concerning a child, the evaluator may consult any person who
may have information about the child and the child's potential parenting arrangements. Upon
order of the court, the evaluator may refer the child to other professional personnel for diagnosis.
The evaluator may consult with and obtain information from medical, mental health,
educational, or other expert persons who have served the child in the past without obtaining the
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 150 of 247
Uncertified Printoutconsent of the parent or the person allocated parental responsibilities for the child; but the child's
consent must be obtained if the child has reached the age of fifteen years unless the court finds
that the child lacks mental capacity to consent. If the requirements of subsections (3) to (7) of
this section are fulfilled, the evaluator's report may be received in evidence at the hearing.
(3) The evaluator shall mail the report to the court and to counsel and to any party not
represented by counsel at least twenty-one days prior to the hearing. The evaluator shall make
available to counsel and to any party not represented by counsel his or her file of underlying data
and reports, complete texts of diagnostic reports made to the evaluator pursuant to the provisions
of subsections (2), (5), and (6) of this section, and the names and addresses of all persons whom
the evaluator has consulted. Any party to the proceeding may call the evaluator and any person
with whom the evaluator has consulted for cross-examination. No party may waive his or her
right of cross-examination prior to the hearing.
(4) A person is not allowed to testify as an expert witness regarding a parental
responsibilities or parenting time evaluation that the person has performed pursuant to this
section unless the court finds that the person is qualified as competent, by training and
experience, in the areas of:
(a) The effects of divorce and remarriage on children, adults, and families;
(a.5) The effects of domestic violence on children, adults, and families, including the
connection between domestic violence and trauma on children, child abuse, and child sexual
abuse in accordance with section 14-10-127.5. The person's training and experience must be
provided by recognized sources with expertise in domestic violence and the traumatic effects of
domestic violence in accordance with section 14-10-127.5. As of January 1, 2024, initial and
ongoing training must include, at a minimum:
(I) Ten initial hours of training on domestic violence, including coercive control, and its
traumatic effects on children, adults, and families;
(II) Ten initial hours of training on child abuse and child sexual abuse and its traumatic
effects; and
(III) Fifteen subsequent hours of training every five years on domestic violence, child
abuse, and child sexual abuse and the traumatic effects on children, adults, and families.
(b) Appropriate parenting techniques;
(c) Child development, including cognitive, personality, emotional, and psychological
development;
(d) Child and adult psychopathology;
(e) Applicable clinical assessment techniques; and
(f) Applicable legal and ethical requirements of parental responsibilities evaluation.
(5) If an evaluation is indicated in an area beyond the training or experience of the
evaluator, the evaluator shall consult with a mental health professional qualified by training or
experience, as described in subsection (4) of this section, in that area. Such areas may include,
but are not limited to, domestic violence, child abuse, child sexual abuse, alcohol or substance
abuse, or psychological testing.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 151 of 247
Uncertified Printout(6) (a) An evaluator may make specific reports when the evaluator has interviewed and
assessed all parties to the dispute, assessed the quality of the relationship, or the potential for
establishing a quality relationship, between the child and each of the parties, and had access to
pertinent information from outside sources.
(b) An evaluator may make reports even though all parties and the child have not been
evaluated by the same evaluator in the following circumstances, if the evaluator states with
particularity the limitations of the evaluator's findings and reports:
(I) Any of the parties reside outside Colorado and it would not be feasible for all parties
and the child to be evaluated by the same mental health professional; or
(II) One party refuses or is unable to cooperate with the court-ordered evaluation; or
(III) The mental health professional is a member of a team of professionals that
performed the evaluation and is presenting recommendations of the team that has interviewed
and assessed all parties to the dispute.
(c) Recommendations should be considered in full context of the report.
(7) (a) A written report of the evaluation shall be provided to the court and to the parties
pursuant to subsection (3) of this section.
(b) The report of the evaluation shall include, but need not be limited to, the following
information:
(I) A description of the procedures employed during the evaluation;
(II) A report of the data collected;
(III) A conclusion that explains how the resulting recommendations were reached from
the data collected, with specific reference to criteria listed in section 14-10-124 (1.5), and, if
applicable, to the criteria listed in section 14-10-131, and their relationship to the results of the
evaluation;
(IV) Recommendations concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities for the
child, including decision-making responsibility, parenting time, and other considerations; and
(V) An explanation of any limitations in the evaluations or any reservations regarding
the resulting recommendations.
(8) All evaluations and reports, including but not limited to supplemental evaluations
and related medical and mental health information, that are submitted to the court pursuant to
this section shall be deemed confidential without the necessity of filing a motion to seal or
otherwise limit access to the court file under the Colorado rules of civil procedure. An evaluation
or report that is deemed confidential under this subsection (8) shall not be made available for
public inspection without an order of the court authorizing public inspection.
(9) On and after January 1, 2022, a party wishing to file a complaint related to a person's
duties as an evaluator shall file such complaint in accordance with the applicable provisions in
chief justice directives.
(10) The requirements of this section apply only to activities related to work performed
that is related to proceedings concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities. All other
licensure requirements for mental health professionals, as established by the department of
regulatory agencies and set forth in article 245 of title 12, still apply.

14-10-127.5. Domestic violence training for court personnel - expert testimony -
child placement decisions - legislative declaration - definitions. (1) (a) The general assembly
finds and declares that:
(I) Approximately fifteen million children are exposed each year to domestic violence or
child abuse;
(II) Most child abuse is perpetrated in the family and by a parent;
(III) A child's risk of abuse increases after a perpetrator of intimate partner violence
separates from the perpetrator's domestic partner, even when the perpetrator had not directly
abused the child previously;
(IV) Empirical research indicates that allegations of child physical and sexual abuse are
regularly discounted by courts when raised in parental allocation cases. Courts believe fewer
than one-fourth of claims that a parent has committed child physical or sexual abuse.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 153 of 247
Uncertified Printout(V) In parental allocation cases in which an alleged or known abusive parent claims
alienation from the child, courts are four times more likely to disbelieve the parent who claims
child physical or sexual abuse;
(VI) Research shows that courts grant custody or unprotected parenting time to an
alleged or known abusive parent;
(VII) Since 2008, nearly eight hundred children have been murdered by a divorcing or
separating parent, with more than one hundred murders occurring after a court ordered the child
into contact with the alleged or known abusive parent despite objections from the parent who
claimed child physical or sexual abuse;
(VIII) Abusive parents frequently claim that abuse allegations are false to minimize or
deny reports of abuse. Experts who testify against abuse allegations often lack expertise in the
relevant type of alleged abuse, relying on unproven theories.
(IX) Judges presiding over parental allocation cases with allegations of child abuse,
child sexual abuse, and domestic violence are rarely required to receive training on these
subjects.
(b) The general assembly therefore declares that:
(I) A child's safety is the first priority of the court in a proceeding affecting the child's
care and custody;
(II) Strengthening the ability of the courts to recognize and adjudicate adult and child
abuse allegations based on valid, admissible evidence will allow courts to enter orders that
protect and minimize risk of harm to the child; and
(III) Court personnel involved in cases containing abuse allegations who receive
trauma-informed training on the dynamics, signs, and impacts of child abuse, child sexual abuse,
and intimate partner violence will help protect and minimize risk of harm to the child.
(2) As used in this section, unless the context otherwise requires:
(a) "Accused party" means a parent in a case to determine parental responsibilities who
has been accused of domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual abuse.
(b) "Protective party" means a parent in a case to determine parental responsibilities who
is competent, protective, not sexually or physically abusive, and with whom a child is bonded or
attached.
(c) "Reunification treatment" means a treatment or therapy aimed at reuniting or
reestablishing a relationship between a child and an estranged or rejected parent or other family
member of the child.
(d) "Task force" means the task force to study victim and survivor awareness and
responsiveness training requirements for judicial personnel created in section 24-33.5-534, as
enacted in House Bill 23-1108.
(e) "Victim service provider" means a nonprofit, nongovernmental or tribal organization
or rape crisis center, including of a state or tribal nation, that is subject to section 13-90-107
(1)(k)(I) and assists or advocates for domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, or
stalking victims, including domestic violence shelters, faith-based organizations, and other
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 154 of 247
Uncertified Printoutorganizations with a documented history of effective work concerning domestic violence, dating
violence, sexual assault, or stalking.
(3) (a) In all proceedings brought pursuant to this title 14 concerning the allocation of
parental responsibilities with respect to a child in which a claim of domestic violence or child
abuse, including child sexual abuse, has been made to the court, or the court has reason to
believe that a party has committed domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual
abuse, the court shall:
(I) Consider the admission of expert testimony and evidence if the expert demonstrates
expertise and experience working with victims of domestic violence or child abuse, including
child sexual abuse, that is not solely forensic in nature; and
(II) Consider evidence of past sexual or physical abuse committed by the accused party,
including:
(A) Any past or current protection or restraining orders against the accused party,
including protection or restraining orders that raise sexual violence or abuse;
(B) Arrests of the accused party for domestic violence, sexual violence, or child abuse;
(C) Convictions of the accused party for domestic violence, sexual violence, or child
abuse; or
(D) Other documentation, including letters from a victim advocate or victim service
provider, if the victim has consented pursuant to section 13-90-107 (1)(k)(I); medical records; or
a letter to a landlord to break a lease.
(b) In determining allocation of parental responsibilities in proceedings brought pursuant
to this title 14 in which a claim of domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual
abuse, has been made to the court, or the court has reason to believe that a party has committed
domestic violence or child abuse, including child sexual abuse, a court shall not:
(I) Remove a child from a protective party solely to improve a deficient relationship with
an accused party;
(II) Restrict contact between a child and a protective party solely to improve a deficient
relationship with an accused party;
(III) Order reunification treatment, unless there is generally accepted and scientifically
valid proof of the safety, effectiveness, and therapeutic value of the reunification treatment; or
(IV) Order reunification treatment that is predicated on cutting off the relationship
between a child and protective party.
(c) If a court issues an order to remediate the resistance of a child to have contact with an
accused party, the order must primarily address the behavior of the accused party, who shall
accept responsibility for the accused party's actions that negatively affected the accused party's
relationship with the child, and a mental health professional approved by the domestic violence
offender management board shall verify the accused party's behavior before the court orders a
protective party to take steps to improve the relationship with the accused party.
(d) In compliance with the federal "Keeping Children Safe From Family Violence Act"
,

14-10-128.1. Appointment of parenting coordinator - disclosure. (1) Pursuant to the
provisions of this section, at any time after the entry of an order concerning parental
responsibilities and upon notice to the parties, the court may, on its own motion, a motion by
either party, or an agreement of the parties, appoint a parenting coordinator as a neutral third
party to assist in the resolution of disputes between the parties concerning parental
responsibilities, including but not limited to implementation of the court-ordered parenting plan.
The parenting coordinator shall be a neutral person with appropriate training and qualifications
and an independent perspective acceptable to the court. Within seven days after the appointment,
the appointed person shall comply with the disclosure provisions of subsection (2.5) of this
section.
(2) (a) Absent agreement of the parties, a court shall not appoint a parenting coordinator
unless the court makes the following findings:
(I) That the parties have failed to adequately implement the parenting plan;
(II) That mediation has been determined by the court to be inappropriate, or, if not
inappropriate, that mediation has been attempted and was unsuccessful; and
(III) That the appointment of a parenting coordinator is in the best interests of the child
or children involved in the parenting plan.
(b) In addition to making the findings required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this
subsection (2), prior to appointing a parenting coordinator, the court may consider the effect of
any claim or documented evidence of domestic violence, as defined in section 14-10-124
(1.3)(a), by the other party on the parties' ability to engage in parent coordination.
(2.5) (a) Within seven days after his or her appointment, the appointed person shall

record, or the judicial officer and, if a relationship exists, the nature of the relationship.
(b) Based on the disclosure required pursuant to paragraph (a) of this subsection (2.5),
the court may, in its discretion, terminate the appointment and appoint a different person in the
proceedings. A party has seven days from the date of the disclosure to object to the appointment

parenting coordinator if the person has served or is serving in the same case as an evaluator
pursuant to section 14-10-127 or a representative of the child pursuant to section 14-10-116.
After appointing a person pursuant to this section to serve as a parenting coordinator in a case,
the court may not subsequently appoint the person to serve in the same case as an evaluator
pursuant to section 14-10-127 or a representative of the child pursuant to section 14-10-116.
(b) The court may appoint a person who has served or is serving in a case as a child and
family investigator pursuant to section 14-10-116.5 to serve in the same case as the parenting
coordinator, upon the agreement of the parties. After appointing a person pursuant to this section
to serve as a parenting coordinator in a case, the court may not subsequently appoint the person
to serve as a child and family investigator in the same case pursuant to section 14-10-116.5.
(5) A court order appointing a parenting coordinator shall be for a specified term; except
that the court order shall not appoint a parenting coordinator for a period of longer than two
years. If an order fails to specify the length of the court-ordered appointment, it shall be
construed to be two years from the date of appointment. Upon agreement of the parties, the court
may extend, modify, or terminate the appointment, including extending the appointment beyond
two years from the date of the original appointment. The court may terminate the appointment of
the parenting coordinator at any time for good cause. The court shall allow the parenting
coordinator to withdraw at any time.

believe was within the scope of his or her duties unless the act or omission causing the injury
was willful and wanton.
(b) Nothing in this subsection (7) shall be construed to bar a party from asserting a
claim:
(I) Based upon a parenting coordinator's failure to comply with the provision set forth in
subsection (8) of this section;
(II) Related to the reasonableness or accuracy of any fee charged or time billed by a
parenting coordinator; or

Uncertified Printout(III) Based upon a negligent act or omission involving the operation of a motor vehicle
by a parenting coordinator.
(c) (I) In a judicial proceeding, administrative proceeding, or other similar proceeding
between the parties to the action, a parenting coordinator shall not be competent to testify and
may not be required to produce records as to any statement, conduct, or decision that occurred
during the parenting coordinator's appointment to the same extent as a judge of a court of this
state acting in a judicial capacity.
(II) This paragraph (c) shall not apply:
(A) To the extent testimony or production of records by the parenting coordinator is
necessary to determine a claim of the parenting coordinator against a party; or

testify or produce records in violation of paragraph (c) of this subsection (7), and the court
determines that the parenting coordinator is immune from civil liability or that the parenting
coordinator is not competent to testify, the court shall award to the parenting coordinator
reasonable attorney fees and reasonable expenses of litigation.

order. The decision-maker appointed pursuant to the provisions of this section may be the same
person as the parenting coordinator appointed pursuant to section 14-10-128.1. At the time of the
appointment, the appointed person shall comply with the disclosure provisions of subsection

fees and costs of the other party and shall pay the fees and costs incurred by the decision-maker

manifestly unjust.
(4.5) (a) Within seven days after his or her appointment, the appointed person shall
disclose to each party, attorneys of record, and the court any familial, financial, or social
relationship that the appointed person has or has had with the child, either party, the attorneys of

consent of all parties, the court may appoint an arbitrator to resolve disputes between the parties
concerning the parties' minor or dependent children, including but not limited to parenting time,

this section shall be in writing. The arbitrator's award shall be effective immediately upon entry
and shall continue in effect until vacated by the arbitrator pursuant to part 2 of article 22 of title
13, C.R.S., modified or corrected by the arbitrator pursuant to part 2 of article 22 of title 13,

14-10-129. Modification of parenting time. (1) (a) (I) Except as otherwise provided in
subsection (1)(b)(I) of this section, the court may make or modify an order granting or denying
parenting time rights whenever such order or modification would serve the best interests of the
child. The trial court retains continuing jurisdiction to make or modify an order granting or
denying parenting time rights pursuant to this section during the pendency of an appeal.
(II) In those cases in which a party with whom the child resides a majority of the time is
seeking to relocate with the child to a residence that substantially changes the geographical ties
between the child and the other party, the court, in determining whether the modification of
parenting time is in the best interests of the child, shall take into account all relevant factors,
including those enumerated in paragraph (c) of subsection (2) of this section. The party who is
intending to relocate with the child to a residence that substantially changes the geographical ties
between the child and the other party shall provide the other party with written notice as soon as
practicable of his or her intent to relocate, the location where the party intends to reside, the
reason for the relocation, and a proposed revised parenting time plan. A court hearing on any
modification of parenting time due to an intent to relocate shall be given a priority on the court's
docket.
(b) (I) The court shall not restrict a parent's parenting time rights unless it finds that the
parenting time would endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair the child's
emotional development. In addition to a finding that parenting time would endanger the child's
physical health or significantly impair the child's emotional development, in any order imposing
or continuing a parenting time restriction, the court shall enumerate the specific factual findings

great-grandparent family time granted pursuant to section 14-10-124.4.
(II) The provisions of subparagraph (I) of this paragraph (b) shall not apply in those
cases in which a party with whom the child resides a majority of the time is intending to relocate
with the child to a residence that substantially changes the geographical ties between the child
and the other party.
(1.5) If a motion for a substantial modification of parenting time which also changes the
party with whom the child resides a majority of the time has been filed, whether or not it has
been granted, no subsequent motion may be filed within two years after disposition of the prior
motion unless the court decides, on the basis of affidavits, that the child's present environment
may endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair the child's emotional
development or that the party with whom the child resides a majority of the time is intending to
relocate with the child to a residence that substantially changes the geographical ties between the
child and the other party.
(2) The court shall not modify a prior order concerning parenting time that substantially
changes the parenting time as well as changes the party with whom the child resides a majority
of the time unless it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that
were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the
circumstances of the child or the party with whom the child resides the majority of the time and
that the modification is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. In applying these
standards, the court shall retain the parenting time schedule established in the prior decree
unless:
(a) The parties agree to the modification; or
(b) The child has been integrated into the family of the moving party with the consent of
the other party; or
(c) The party with whom the child resides a majority of the time is intending to relocate
with the child to a residence that substantially changes the geographical ties between the child
and the other party. A court hearing on any modification of parenting time due to an intent to
relocate shall be given a priority on the court's docket. In determining whether the modification
of parenting time is in the best interests of the child, the court shall take into account all relevant
factors, including whether a party has committed an act of domestic violence, has engaged in a
pattern of domestic violence, or has a history of domestic violence, as that term is defined in
section 14-10-124 (1.3), which factor shall be supported by a preponderance of the evidence, and
shall consider such domestic violence whether it occurred before or after the prior decree, and all
other factors enumerated in section 14-10-124 (1.5)(a) and:
(I) The reasons why the party wishes to relocate with the child;
(II) The reasons why the opposing party is objecting to the proposed relocation;
(III) The history and quality of each party's relationship with the child since any previous
parenting time order;
(IV) The educational opportunities for the child at the existing location and at the
proposed new location;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 164 of 247
Uncertified Printout(V) The presence or absence of extended family at the existing location and at the
proposed new location;
(VI) Any advantages of the child remaining with the primary caregiver;
(VII) The anticipated impact of the move on the child;
(VIII) Whether the court will be able to fashion a reasonable parenting time schedule if
the change requested is permitted; and
(IX) Any other relevant factors bearing on the best interests of the child; or
(d) The child's present environment endangers the child's physical health or significantly
impairs the child's emotional development and the harm likely to be caused by a change of
environment is outweighed by the advantage of a change to the child.
(2.5) (a) When the court restricts a party's parenting time pursuant to section 19-5-105.5,
C.R.S., or section 19-5-105.7, C.R.S., or section 14-10-124 (4)(a)(IV), the court may make or
modify an order granting or denying parenting time rights whenever such order or modification
would serve the best interests of the child. Within thirty-five days after the filing of a verified
motion by the restricted party seeking a modification of parenting time, the court shall determine
from the verified motion, and response to the motion, if any, whether there has been a substantial
and continuing change of circumstances such that the current parenting time orders are no longer
in the child's best interests, including consideration of whether the restricted parent has
satisfactorily complied with any conditions set forth by the court when the court imposed the
restrictions on parenting time, and either:
(I) Deny the motion, if there is an inadequate allegation; or
(II) Set the matter for hearing as expeditiously as possible with notice to the parties of
the time and place of the hearing.
(b) If the court finds that the filing of a motion under paragraph (a) of this subsection
(2.5) was substantially frivolous, substantially groundless, substantially vexatious, or intended to
harass or intimidate the other party, the court shall require the moving party to pay the
reasonable and necessary attorney fees and costs of the other party.
(3) (a) If a parent has been convicted of any of the crimes listed in paragraph (b) of this
subsection (3) or convicted in another state or jurisdiction, including but not limited to a military
or federal jurisdiction, of an offense that, if committed in Colorado, would constitute any of the
crimes listed in paragraph (b) of this subsection (3), or convicted of any crime in which the
underlying factual basis has been found by the court on the record to include an act of domestic
violence, as defined in section 18-6-800.3 (1), C.R.S., that constitutes a potential threat or
endangerment to the child, the other parent, or any other person who has been granted custody of
or parental responsibility for the child pursuant to court order may file an objection to parenting
time with the court. The other parent or other person having custody or parental responsibility
shall give notice to the offending parent of such objection as provided by the Colorado rules of
civil procedure, and the offending parent shall have twenty-one days from such notice to
respond. If the offending parent fails to respond within twenty-one days, the parenting time
rights of such parent shall be suspended until further order of the court. If such parent responds
and objects, a hearing shall be held within thirty-five days of such response. The court may
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 165 of 247
Uncertified Printoutdetermine that any offending parent who responds and objects shall be responsible for the costs
associated with any hearing, including reasonable attorney fees incurred by the other parent. In
making such determination, the court shall consider the criminal record of the offending parent
and any actions to harass the other parent and the children, any mitigating actions by the
offending parent, and whether the actions of either parent have been substantially frivolous,
substantially groundless, or substantially vexatious. The offending parent shall have the burden
at the hearing to prove that parenting time by such parent is in the best interests of the child or
children.
(b) The provisions of paragraph (a) of this subsection (3) shall apply to the following
crimes:
(I) Murder in the first degree, as defined in section 18-3-102, C.R.S.;
(II) Murder in the second degree, as defined in section 18-3-103, C.R.S.;

existed prior to July 1, 2000;
(V) Sexual assault in the second degree, as described in section 18-3-403, C.R.S., as it
existed prior to July 1, 2000;
(VI) (A) Unlawful sexual contact if the victim is compelled to submit, as described in
section 18-3-404 (2), C.R.S.; and
(B) Sexual assault in the third degree if the victim is compelled to submit, as described
in section 18-3-404 (2), C.R.S., as it existed prior to July 1, 2000;
(VII) Sexual assault on a child, as defined in section 18-3-405, C.R.S.;

(XX) Patronizing a prostituted child, as defined in section 18-7-406, C.R.S.
(c) If the party was convicted in another state or jurisdiction of an offense that, if
committed in Colorado, would constitute an offense listed in subparagraphs (III) to (XX) of
paragraph (b) of this subsection (3), the court shall order that party to submit to a
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 166 of 247
Uncertified Printoutsex-offense-specific evaluation and a parental risk assessment in Colorado and the court shall
consider the recommendations of the evaluation and the assessment in any order the court makes
relating to parenting time or parental contact. The convicted party shall pay for the costs of the
evaluation and the assessment.
(4) A motion to restrict parenting time or parental contact with a parent which alleges
that the child is in imminent physical or emotional danger due to the parenting time or contact by
the parent shall be heard and ruled upon by the court not later than fourteen days after the day of
the filing of the motion. Any parenting time which occurs during such fourteen-day period after

14-10-129.5. Disputes concerning parenting time. (1) Within thirty-five days after the
filing of a verified motion by either parent or upon the court's own motion alleging that a parent
is not complying with a parenting time order or schedule and setting forth the possible sanctions
that may be imposed by the court, the court shall determine from the verified motion, and
response to the motion, if any, whether there has been or is likely to be substantial or continuing
noncompliance with the parenting time order or schedule and either:
(a) Deny the motion, if there is an inadequate allegation; or
(b) Set the matter for hearing with notice to the parents of the time and place of the
hearing as expeditiously as possible; or
(c) Require the parties to seek mediation and report back to the court on the results of the

agreement reached by the parents or shall set the matter for hearing.

time order or schedule and has violated the court order, the court, in the best interests of the
child, shall issue an order that may include but not be limited to one or more of the following

which was denied, including but not limited to parenting time during weekends, on holidays, and
on weekdays and during the summer;
(II) That such parenting time is made up within six months after the noncompliance
occurs, unless the period of time or holiday can not be made up within six months in which case
the parenting time shall be made up within one year after the noncompliance occurs;
(III) That such parenting time takes place at the time and in the manner chosen by the
aggrieved parent if it is in the best interests of the child;

(h) Any other order that may promote the best interests of the child or children involved.

court shall order a parent who has failed to provide court-ordered parenting time or to exercise
court-ordered parenting time to pay to the aggrieved party, attorney's fees, court costs, and
expenses that are associated with an action brought pursuant to this section. In the event the
parent responding to an action brought pursuant to this section is found not to be in violation of
the parenting time order or schedule, the court may order the petitioning parent to pay the court
costs, attorney fees, and expenses incurred by such responding parent. Nothing in this section
shall preclude a party's right to a separate and independent legal action in tort.

14-10-130. Judicial supervision. (1) Except as otherwise agreed by the parties in
writing at the time of the decree concerning the allocation of parental responsibilities with
respect to a child, the person or persons with responsibility for decision-making may determine
the child's upbringing, including his or her education, health care, and religious training, unless
the court, after hearing and upon motion by the other party, finds that, in the absence of a
specific limitation of the person's or persons' decision-making authority, the child's physical
health would be endangered or the child's emotional development significantly impaired.
(2) If both parties or all contestants agree to the order or if the court finds that in the
absence of the order the child's physical health would be endangered or the child's emotional
development significantly impaired, the court may order the county or district welfare
department to exercise continuing supervision over the case to assure that the terms relating to
the allocation of parental responsibilities with respect to the child or parenting time terms of the
decree are carried out.

14-10-131. Modification of custody or decision-making responsibility. (1) If a motion
for modification of a custody decree or a decree allocating decision-making responsibility has
been filed, whether or not it was granted, no subsequent motion may be filed within two years
after disposition of the prior motion unless the court decides, on the basis of affidavits, that there
is reason to believe that a continuation of the prior decree of custody or order allocating
decision-making responsibility may endanger the child's physical health or significantly impair
the child's emotional development.
(2) The court shall not modify a custody decree or a decree allocating decision-making
responsibility unless it finds, upon the basis of facts that have arisen since the prior decree or that
were unknown to the court at the time of the prior decree, that a change has occurred in the
circumstances of the child or the child's custodian or party to whom decision-making
responsibility was allocated and that the modification is necessary to serve the best interests of
the child. The trial court retains jurisdiction to modify an order allocating decision-making
responsibility pursuant to this section during the pendency of an appeal. In applying these
standards, the court shall retain the allocation of decision-making responsibility established by
the prior decree unless:
(a) The parties agree to the modification;
(b) The child has been integrated into the family of the petitioner with the consent of the
other party and such situation warrants a modification of the allocation of decision-making
responsibilities;
(b.5) There has been a modification in the parenting time order pursuant to section
14-10-129, that warrants a modification of the allocation of decision-making responsibilities;
(b.7) A party has consistently consented to the other party making individual decisions
for the child which decisions the party was to make individually or the parties were to make
mutually; or
(c) The retention of the allocation of decision-making responsibility would endanger the
child's physical health or significantly impairs the child's emotional development and the harm
likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed by the advantage of a change to
the child.

14-10.5-102. Legislative declaration. (1) The general assembly finds and declares that
in most situations it is important to the healthy development of children that the children spend
quality time with both parents. The general assembly further finds that due to dissolution of
marriage, legal separation, and children born to single parents, families are often divided. As a
result, many children do not have the opportunity to spend the time with both parents that a court
may have determined is in their best interests.
(2) The general assembly further finds that the federal "Personal Responsibility and
Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996", Public Law 104-193, allows states to seek grants
of federal funds for the establishment and administration of programs and to support and
facilitate children's access to time with their noncustodial parent.
(3) It is the purpose of this article to enhance children's opportunities for access to their

the commencement of the proceeding, a proceeding concerning the custody of the child has been

motion of a party, the court's own motion, or request of another court.
(2) Before determining whether it is an inconvenient forum, a court of this state shall
consider whether it is appropriate for a court of another state to exercise jurisdiction. For this
purpose, the court shall allow the parties to submit information and shall consider all relevant

invoke its jurisdiction necessary and reasonable expenses including costs, communication
expenses, attorney fees, investigative fees, expenses for witnesses, travel expenses, and child
care during the course of the proceedings, unless the party from whom fees are sought

seeking enforcement of a child-custody determination, the petitioner may file a verified
application for the issuance of a warrant to take physical custody of the child if the child is
immediately likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this state.
(2) If the court, upon the testimony of the petitioner or other witness, finds that the child
is imminently likely to suffer serious physical harm or be removed from this state, it may issue a
warrant to take physical custody of the child. The petition must be heard on the next judicial day
after the warrant is executed unless that date is impossible. In that event, the court shall hold the

may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.

sufficient to serve as a financial deterrent to abduction, the proceeds of which may be used to
pay for the reasonable expenses of recovery of the child, including reasonable attorneys fees and

article contains allegations, and the court finds that there is a credible risk that the child is
imminently likely to be wrongfully removed, the court may issue an ex parte warrant to take
physical custody of the child.
(2) The respondent on a petition under subsection (1) of this section must be afforded an
opportunity to be heard at the earliest possible time after the ex parte warrant is executed, but not

national crime information center system and similar state databases to determine if either the
petitioner or respondent has a history of domestic violence, stalking, or child abuse or neglect.
(5) The petition and warrant must be served on the respondent when or immediately
after the child is taken into physical custody.
(6) A warrant to take physical custody of a child, issued by this state or another state, is
enforceable throughout this state. If the court finds that a less intrusive remedy will not be
effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical
custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances, the court may authorize law
enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.
(7) If the court finds, after a hearing, that a petitioner sought an ex parte warrant under
subsection (1) of this section for the purpose of harassment or in bad faith, the court may award
the respondent reasonable attorneys fees, costs, and expenses.

14-14-104. Recovery for child support debt. (1) Any payment of public assistance by a
county department of human or social services made to or for the benefit of any dependent child
or children creates a debt, which is due and owing to the county department of human or social
services, recoverable by the county as a debt due to the state by the parent or parents who are
responsible for support of the dependent child or children, or by the parent whose rights were
terminated pursuant to section 19-5-105.5 and who was ordered to pay child support for the
benefit of a dependent child, in an amount to be determined as follows:
(a) Where there has been a court order directed to a parent, the child support debt of that
parent is an amount equal to the amount of public assistance paid to the extent of the full amount
of arrearages under the order. However, the county department of human or social services,
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 219 of 247
Uncertified Printoutthrough its delegate child support enforcement unit, may petition for modification of the order on
the same grounds as a party to the action.
(b) Where there has been no court or administrative order for child support, the county
department of human or social services, through its delegate child support enforcement unit, may
initiate a court or administrative action to establish the amount of child support debt accrued, and
the court or delegate child support enforcement unit, after hearing or upon stipulation or upon a
default order, shall enter an order for child support debt. The debt must be based on the amount
of current child support due, or which would have been due if there were an existing order for
child support, under the current child support enforcement guidelines in effect on the date of the
stipulation, default order, or hearing to establish the child support debt times the number of
months the family received public assistance. The total amount of child support debt must not
exceed the total amount paid for public assistance. A child support debt established pursuant to
this subsection (1)(b) is in addition to any subsequent child support debt accrued pursuant to
subsection (1)(a) of this section.
(2) The county department of human or social services, through its delegate child
support enforcement unit, must be subrogated to the right of the dependent child or children or
person having legal and physical custody of said child or children or having been allocated
decision-making authority with respect to the child or children to pursue any child support action
existing under the laws of this state to obtain reimbursement of public assistance expended. If a
court enters a judgment for or orders the payment of any amount of child support to be paid by
an obligor, the county department of human or social services must be subrogated to the debt
created by such judgment or order.
(3) An agreement between any one parent or custodial person or person allocated
parental responsibilities and the obligor, either relieving the obligor of any duty of support or
responsibility therefor or purporting to settle past, present, or future child support obligations
either as settlement or as prepayment, must not act to reduce or terminate any rights of the
county department of human or social services to recover from that obligor for any public
assistance provided unless the county department of human or social services, through its
delegate child support enforcement unit, has consented to the agreement, in writing, and the
written consent has been incorporated into and made a part of the agreement.
(4) Any parental rights with respect to custody or decision-making responsibility with
respect to a child or parenting time that are granted by a court of competent jurisdiction or are
subject to court review must remain unaffected by the establishment or enforcement of a child
support debt or obligation by the county department of human or social services or other person
pursuant to the provisions of this article 14; and the establishment or enforcement of any such
child support debt or obligation must also remain unaffected by such parental rights with respect
to custody or decision-making responsibility with respect to a child or parenting time.
(5) No child support debt under this section shall be created in the case of, or at any time
collected from, a parent who receives assistance under the Colorado works program as described
in part 7 of article 2 of title 26, C.R.S., for the period such parent is receiving such assistance,
unless by order of a court of competent jurisdiction.
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 220 of 247
Uncertified Printout(6) Creation of a child support debt pursuant to this section must not modify or
extinguish any rights that the county department of human or social services has obtained or may
obtain under an assignment of child support rights, including the right to recover and retain
unreimbursed public assistance.
(7) When a portion of a public assistance grant, paid to or for the benefit of a dependent
child, includes moneys paid to provide the custodial parent or the parent with whom the child
resides the majority of the time or caretaker relative with necessities including but not limited to
shelter, medical care, clothing, or transportation, then those moneys are deemed to be paid to or
for the benefit of the dependent child.
(8) Notwithstanding rule 98 of the Colorado rules of civil procedure, venue for an action
to establish child support debt is proper in any county where public assistance was or is being
paid, in any county where the obligor parent resides, or in any county where the child resides.
(9) A copy of the computer printout obtained from the state department of human
services of the record of payments of assistance under the Colorado works program as described
in part 7 of article 2 of title 26, C.R.S., made on behalf of a child whose custodian has been
receiving child support enforcement services pursuant to section 26-13-106, C.R.S., shall be
admissible into evidence as proof of such payments in any proceeding to establish child support
debt and shall be prima facie evidence of the amount of child support debt owing on behalf of
said child.

14-14-105. Continuing garnishment. (1) A writ of garnishment for the collection from
earnings of judgments for arrearages for child support, for maintenance when combined with
child support, for child support debts, or for maintenance shall be continuing; shall have priority
over any garnishment, lien, or income assignment other than a writ previously served on the
same garnishee pursuant to this subsection (1) or a wage assignment activated pursuant to
section 14-14-107 or section 14-14-111, as those sections existed prior to July 1, 1996, or an
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 221 of 247

withhold, pursuant to section 13-54-104 (3), C.R.S., the portion of earnings subject to
garnishment at each succeeding earnings disbursement interval until such judgment is satisfied
or the garnishment is released by the court or in writing by the judgment creditor.
(2) No employer may discharge an employee solely for the reason that his earnings have
been subjected to garnishment pursuant to this section. Any such discharge in violation of this
subsection (2) shall subject the employer to liability for damages.

14-14-106. Interest. (1) (a) Interest per annum at four percent greater than the statutory
rate set forth in section 5-12-101 on any arrearages and child support debt due and owing before
July 1, 2021, may be compounded monthly and may be collected by the judgment creditor;
however, such interest may be waived by the judgment creditor and such creditor is not required
to maintain interest balance due accounts. After July 1, 2021, interest on child support arrearages
and child support debt accrues at the interest rate specified in subsection (1)(b) of this section.
(b) Interest per annum at two percent greater than the statutory rate set forth in section
5-12-101 on any arrearages and child support debt due and owing on and after July 1, 2021, may
be compounded annually and may be collected by the judgment creditor; except that such
interest may be waived by the judgment creditor and such creditor is not required to maintain
interest balance due accounts.
(2) If the judgment creditor seeks interest on child support arrearages as set forth in
subsection (1) of this section, the debtor obligor may apply to the court to request that the court
find good cause to use discretion in disallowing the calculated interest, or a portion thereof, on
child support arrearages. In so doing, the court shall consider but is not limited to the following:
(a) Whether good cause existed for the nonpayment of the child support;
(b) Whether payment of the interest would result in undue hardship or substantial
injustice for the obligor owing the interest; and
(c) Whether the disallowance or reduction of interest would result in undue hardship and
substantial injustice to the person to whom the interest is owed.
(3) The court may determine an equitable period of repayment of any interest and arrears
owed, if applicable, as set forth in this section.

ordered, an interested party may apply to the court for an order requiring that the obligor post
security, a bond, or other form of guarantee to secure payment of the child support ordered. In
considering such request, the court shall consider, among other factors, the nature of the obligor's
employment and whether the obligor's income is unreachable by a wage assignment entered
pursuant to section 14-14-107 prior to July 1, 1996, or by immediate deduction for a family
support obligation pursuant to section 14-14-111 as it existed prior to July 1, 1996, or by an
income assignment entered pursuant to section 14-14-111.5 on or after July 1, 1996.

on the issue. Such notice shall contain a statement of the obligor's rights to appear and contest

14-14-110. Contempt of court. (1) Evidence of noncompliance with an order for child
support, or maintenance when combined with child support, in the form of an affidavit from the
clerk of the court or in the form of a copy of the record of payments certified by the clerk of the
court or in the form of a copy of the record of payment maintained by the family support registry
is prima facie evidence of contempt of court.
(2) In determining whether or not the obligor is in contempt of court, the court may
consider that the required payment has been made prior to the hearing to determine contempt or
that owing to physical incapacity or other good cause the obligor was unable to furnish the
support, care, and maintenance required by the order for the period of noncompliance alleged in
the motion.
(3) If, after personal service of the citation and a copy of the motion and affidavit, the
obligor fails to appear at the time so designated, the court may issue a warrant for the obligor's
arrest. Upon issuance of the warrant, the court shall direct by endorsement thereon the amount of
the bond required.
(4) Pursuant to subsection (3) of this section, where the obligor has been released upon
deposit of cash, stocks, or bonds, or upon surety bond secured by property, if the obligor fails to
appear in accordance with the primary condition of the bond, the court shall declare a forfeiture.
Notice of the order of forfeiture shall be mailed immediately by the court to the obligor and
sureties, if any, at the last-known address. If the obligor does not appear and surrender to the
court having jurisdiction within thirty days after the date of the forfeiture, or within that period
satisfy the court that appearance and surrender by the obligor is impossible and without the
obligor's fault, the court shall enter judgment against the obligor and the sureties, if any, for the
amount of the bail and costs of the court proceedings.
(5) Any moneys collected or paid upon any such execution or in any case upon said
bond shall be turned over to the clerk of the court in which the bond is given to be applied to the
child support obligation, including where the obligation is assigned to the department of human
services pursuant to section 26-2-111 (3), C.R.S.

14-14-111.5. Income assignments for child support or maintenance. (1) Legislative
declaration. The general assembly hereby finds and declares that, for the good of the children of
Colorado and to promote family self-sufficiency, there is a need to strengthen Colorado's child
support enforcement laws and to simplify, streamline, and clarify the existing laws relating to
wage assignments previously provided for in section 14-14-107 and immediate deductions for
family support obligations previously provided for in section 14-14-111. In support of this effort,
the general assembly hereby adopts the term "income assignment" to be used to provide
consistency and standardization of the process for collecting child support and maintenance.
(2) (a) Whenever an obligation for child support, maintenance, child support when
combined with maintenance, retroactive support, medical support, child support arrears, or child
support debt is initially determined, whether temporary or permanent or whether modified, the
amount of child support, maintenance, child support when combined with maintenance,
retroactive support, medical support, child support arrears, or child support debt shall be ordered
by the court or delegate child support enforcement unit to be activated immediately as an income
assignment subject to section 13-54-104 (3), from the income, as defined in section 14-10-115
(3), that is due or is to become due in the future from the obligor's employer, employers, or
successor employers or other payor of funds, regardless of the source, of the person obligated to
pay the child support, maintenance, child support when combined with maintenance, retroactive
support, medical support, child support arrears, or child support debt.
(b) Any order for support must include the following, if available:
(I) The name, date of birth, and sex of each child for whom the support is ordered;
(II) The obligee's name, residential and mailing addresses, and date of birth;
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 225 of 247
Uncertified Printout(III) The total amount of current support to be paid monthly in each category of support;
(IV) The date of commencement of the order and the date or dates of the month that the
payments are due;
(V) The total amount of arrears that is due, if any, in each category of support as of the
date of the order; and
(VI) The obligor's name, residential and mailing addresses, and date of birth.
(3) Activation of income assignment. Income assignments must be activated in
accordance with the following provisions:
(a) Immediate activation of income assignments. (I) (A) Upon entry of an order for
child support, maintenance, child support when combined with maintenance, retroactive support,
medical support, child support arrears, or child support debt, the obligee, the obligee's
representative, or the delegate child support enforcement unit shall cause a notice of income
assignment to be served immediately as described in subsection (4) of this section.
(B) Unless an income assignment is required to be immediately activated pursuant to
subsection (3)(a)(I)(A) of this section, or the income assignment is not subject to immediate
activation pursuant to subsection (3)(a)(II) of this section, an income assignment may be
immediately activated by the obligee, the obligee's representative, or the delegate child support
enforcement unit by causing a notice to withhold income for support to be served upon the
employer, trustee, or other payor of funds pursuant to subsection (4) of this section.
(II) Exceptions to immediate activation of income assignments. Income is not subject
to immediate activation of an income assignment pursuant to this subsection (3)(a) in any case in
which:
(A) One of the parties demonstrates, and the court or the delegate child support
enforcement unit finds in writing, that there is good cause not to require immediate activation of
an income assignment. For the purposes of this sub-subparagraph (A), "good cause" means the
following: There is a written determination and explanation by the court or delegate child
support enforcement unit stating why implementing immediate activation of an income
assignment would not be in the best interests of the child; and the obligor has signed a written
agreement to keep the delegate child support enforcement unit, the obligee, or the obligee's
representative informed of the obligor's current employer and information on any health
insurance coverage to which the obligor has access; and proof is provided that the obligor made
timely payments without the necessity of income assignment in previously ordered child support
obligations.
(B) A written agreement is reached between both parties that provides for an alternative
arrangement, and such agreement is reviewed and approved in the record by the court. For
purposes of this subsection (3)(a)(II)(B), the delegate child support enforcement unit is
considered a party in all cases in which the custodian of a child is receiving support enforcement
services from a delegate child support enforcement unit pursuant to section 26-13-106 (1) and as
such must consent to the alternative written agreement. In all cases in which the custodian of a
child is receiving support enforcement services from a delegate child support enforcement unit
pursuant to section 26-13-106 (2), the obligee or the obligee's representative shall provide the
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 226 of 247
Uncertified Printoutdelegate child support enforcement unit with notice of any agreement reached between the
parties pursuant to this subsection (3)(a)(II)(B).
(b) (I) to (III) Repealed.
(IV) Agreement to activate. When an income assignment is activated pursuant to this
subsection (3) and arrears are owed, as verified by the affidavit of arrears, the parties may agree
to an amount of payment on the arrears, or the court or delegate child support enforcement unit
may determine an appropriate amount for payment.
(V) Repealed.
(VI) A payment on arrears, plus interest, for support, if any, shall be included in an
activated income assignment; however, the combined payment on current support and arrears is
subject to section 13-54-104 (3), C.R.S.
(VII) Objections to income assignment. (A) The obligor may file with the court a
written objection to the activation of an income assignment pursuant to this subsection (3) no
later than fourteen days after actual notice. The obligor shall mail a copy of the written objection
to the obligee or the obligee's representative.
(B) The objection shall be limited to the defense that there is a mistake of fact such as an
error in the identity of the obligor or in the amount of the support.
(C) If the obligor files an objection, the court shall set and hold a hearing within
forty-two days after the date the income assignment was issued. The court shall deny the
objection without hearing if a defense in subsection (3)(a)(VII)(B) of this section is not alleged.
(D) At a hearing on an objection, the sole issue before the court is whether there was a
mistake of fact as specified in sub-subparagraph (B) of this subparagraph (VII).
(E) At a hearing on an objection, reasonable attorney fees and costs may be awarded to
the prevailing party.
(F) If an objection is based on the amount of arrears, the income assignment may be
activated and enforced as to current support obligations, and the activation of the income
assignment as to arrears shall be stayed pending the outcome of a hearing on such objection.
(4) Notice to withhold income for support. (a) Except as provided in subsection (4)(b)
of this section, a notice to withhold income for support must be served upon the employer,
trustee, or other payor of funds by first-class mail or by electronic service if the employer,
trustee, or other payor of funds mutually agrees with the state child support enforcement agency
to receive such income assignments electronically. Receipt of notice by the employer, trustee, or
other payor of funds confers jurisdiction of the court over the employer, trustee, or other payor
of funds.
(b) A notice to withhold income for support is not required if the obligor's source of
income is unemployment compensation benefits and the custodian of the child is receiving
support enforcement services pursuant to section 26-13-106. In such cases, the state child
support enforcement agency shall electronically intercept the unemployment compensation
benefits through an automated interface with the department of labor and employment.
(c) A notice to withhold income for support must be provided on a federal office of
management and budget-approved income withholding for support form and must contain the
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 227 of 247
Uncertified Printoutfollowing information and, except in cases in which the obligee is receiving child support

will total the monthly amount due.
(B) A statement that the employer, trustee, or other payor of funds may deduct a fee to
defray the cost of withholding and that the employer, trustee, or other payor of funds shall refer
to the laws governing the work state of the employee for the allowable amount of such fee; and
(C) That, if section 13-54-104 (3) applies, the employer, trustee, or other payor of funds
shall not withhold more than the limitations set by said section;

support registry, if required to be sent to the registry, if the individual amount of each
disbursement is identified as required by subsection (4)(c)(IV)(C) of this section;

insurance for the children who are the subject of the order;

income as the notice to withhold income for support directs, the employer, trustee, or other payor
of funds is liable for both the accumulated amount that should have been withheld from the
obligor's income and any other penalties set by state law;
(VII) A statement that the employer, trustee, or other payor of funds is subject to a fine
determined pursuant to state law for discharging an obligor from employment, refusing to
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 228 of 247
Uncertified Printoutemploy an obligor, or taking disciplinary action against an obligor because of a notice to
withhold income for support;
(VIII) A statement that the employer shall notify the family support registry, in writing,
if payments are required to be made through the registry promptly after the obligor terminates
employment and that the employer shall provide the family support registry, in writing, with the
obligor's name; date of separation; case identifier, which is the family support registry account
number; last-known home address; and the name and address of the obligor's new employer, if
known;
(IX) A statement that withholding under the notice to withhold income for support has

levies in effect before receipt of this notice to withhold income for support have priority, and that
the requesting agency should be contacted if there are federal tax levies in effect;
(X) A statement that as long as the obligor is employed by the employer, the income
assignment must not be terminated or modified, except upon written notice by the obligee, the
obligee's representative, the delegate child support enforcement unit, or the court;
(XI) A statement that the employer, trustee, or other payor of funds is required to report

(XIV) A statement that a fraudulent submission of a notice to withhold income for
support subjects the person submitting the notice to an employer, trustee, or other payor of funds
to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars and court costs and attorney fees.
(4.5) When a Colorado employer receives an income assignment, or its equivalent,
issued by another state, the employer shall apply the income assignment law of the obligor's
principal state of employment. The obligor's principal state of employment shall be presumed to
be Colorado unless there is a specific employment contract to the contrary.
(4.7) Income assignments must be paid through the family support registry pursuant to
section 26-13-114.
(5) When activated, an income assignment shall be a continuing income assignment and
shall remain in effect and shall be binding upon any employer, trustee, or other payer of funds
upon whom it is served until further notice from the obligee, the obligee's representative, the
delegate child support enforcement unit, or the court.
(6) Priority. (a) A notice of income assignment for support shall have priority over any
garnishment, attachment, or lien.
(b) If there is more than one income assignment for support for the same obligor, the
total amount withheld, which is subject to the limits specified in section 13-54-104 (3), C.R.S.,
shall be distributed in accordance with the priorities set forth in this paragraph (b):
Colorado Revised Statutes 2023 Page 229 of 247
Uncertified Printout(I) (A) First priority shall be given to income assignments for orders for current monthly
child support obligations and maintenance when included in the child support order.
(B) If the amount withheld is sufficient to pay the current monthly support and
maintenance for all orders, the employer or other payer of funds shall distribute the amount to all
orders and proceed to the second priority to distribute any remaining withholding. If the amount
withheld is not sufficient to pay the current monthly support and maintenance in all orders, the
employer shall add the current monthly support and maintenance in all orders for a total and then
divide the amount of current monthly support and maintenance in each order by the total to
determine the percent of the total for each order. The percent for each order derived from such
calculation shall be multiplied by the total amount withheld to determine what proportionate
share of the amount withheld shall be paid for each order.
(II) (A) Second priority shall be given to income assignments for all orders for medical
support when there is a specific amount ordered for medical support.
(B) If the amount withheld is sufficient to pay the medical support for all orders, the
employer shall distribute the amount to all orders and proceed to the third priority to distribute
any remaining withholding. If the amount withheld is not sufficient to pay the medical support in
all orders, the employer shall add the medical support in all orders for a total and then divide the
amount of medical support in each order by the total to determine the percent of the total for
each order. The percent for each order derived from such calculation shall be multiplied by the
total amount withheld to determine what proportionate share of the amount withheld shall be
paid for each order.
(III) (A) Third priority shall be given to income assignments for child support debt and
support arrears, including medical support arrears.
(B) If the amount withheld is sufficient to pay the child support debt and support arrears
for all orders, the employer shall distribute the amount to all orders and proceed to the fourth
priority to distribute any remaining withholding. If the amount withheld is not sufficient to pay
the child support debt and support arrears in all orders, the employer shall add the child support
debt and support arrears in all orders for a total and then divide the amount of child support debt
and support arrears in each order by the total to determine the percent of the total for each order.
The percent for each order derived from such calculation shall be multiplied by the total amount
withheld to determine what proportionate share of the amount withheld shall be paid for each
order.
(IV) (A) Fourth priority shall be given to income assignments for orders for maintenance
only.
(B) If the amount withheld is sufficient to pay the maintenance only for all orders, the
employer shall distribute the amount to all orders. If the amount withheld is not sufficient to pay
the maintenance only in all orders, the employer shall add the maintenance only in all orders for
a total and then divide the amount of maintenance only in each order by the total to determine
the percent of the total for each order. The percent for each order derived from such calculation
shall be multiplied by the total amount withheld to determine what proportionate share of the
amount withheld shall be paid for each order.

status of the child's parents when he or she was born or whether the child is claimed as a
dependent on the obligor's federal or state income tax return, lives with the obligor, or lives
within the insurer's service area, notwithstanding any other provision of law restricting

(5) An employer who wrongfully fails to deduct for health insurance in accordance with
the provisions of this section may be held liable for an amount up to the accumulated amount of
such premiums the employer or payer should have withheld from the obligor's wages.

this section, and the obligor is no longer employed by the employer, the employer shall promptly
notify the court in writing of the obligor's last-known address, social security number, and the
name of the obligor's new employer, if known.
(7) If an employer discharges an employee in violation of the provisions of this section,
the employee may, within ninety days, bring a civil action for the recovery of wages lost as a
result of the violation and for an order requiring the reinstatement of the employee. Damages
recoverable shall be lost wages not to exceed six weeks, costs, and reasonable attorney fees.
(8) A notice to deduct for health insurance issued and served pursuant to this section
shall be continuing and shall remain in effect and be binding on any current or successor

14-15-102. Legislative declaration. The general assembly declares that the public policy
of this state, as set forth in section 31 of article II of the state constitution, recognizes only the
union of one man and one woman as a marriage. The general assembly declares that the purpose
of this article is to provide eligible couples the opportunity to obtain the benefits, protections,
and responsibilities afforded by Colorado law to spouses consistent with the principles of
equality under law and religious freedom embodied in both the United States constitution and
the constitution of this state. The general assembly declares that a second purpose of the act is to
protect individuals who are or may become partners in a civil union against discrimination in
employment, housing, and in places of public accommodation. The general assembly further
finds that the general assembly, in the exercise of its plenary power, has the authority to define
other arrangements, such as a civil union between two unmarried persons regardless of their
gender, and to set forth in statute any state-level benefits, rights, and protections to which a
couple is entitled by virtue of entering into a civil union. The general assembly finds that the
"Colorado Civil Union Act" does not alter the public policy of this state, which recognizes only
the union of one man and one woman as a marriage. The general assembly also declares that a
third purpose in enacting the "Colorado Civil Union Act" is to state that Colorado courts may
offer same-sex couples the equal protection of the law and to give full faith and credit to
recognize relationships legally created in other jurisdictions that are similar to civil unions
created by this article and that are not otherwise recognized pursuant to Colorado law.

14-15-117. Application of article to joint tax returns - legislative declaration. (1) The
general assembly finds that some partners in a civil union may legally have their federal taxable

separate federal tax returns must have such income separately determined for purposes of the
Colorado income tax; and
(b) Partners in a civil union who have their federal taxable income determined on a joint
federal tax return must have their state taxable income determined based on their joint federal
taxable income.
