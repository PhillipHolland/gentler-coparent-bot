### The Enduring Impacts of Reunification Camps: and Next Steps for Legislation

**May 29, 2023**

The past seven months would be best described as an avalanche of survivor’s voices: children and young adults who have been affected by the alienation industry and reunification camps. Reunification camps are finally receiving international media attention, which is long overdue. The first reunification camp dates back to the early 2000’s with disturbing ties to the Synanon Cult, yet this unsound, unregulated industry has flown under the radar and flourished for decades. While we have heard sporadic outcries from survivors and from their protective parents over the years, this issue has failed to garner the attention it deserves. This all changed in October 2022, when 15-year-old Maya Laing of Santa Cruz County, California, took to Instagram with accusations that she and her younger brother, Sebastian, were being failed by family court professionals.

We are further fueled and empowered by a recent United Nations report titled, “Custody, violence against women and violence against children: Report of the Special Rapporteur (Reem Alsalem) on violence against women and girls, it’s causes and consequences.” The United Nations joins the World Health Organization, the United States Federal Government, the American Psychological Association, and the American Medical Association in taking a firm stance against the denounced, debunked concept of parental alienation. Today, we’re highlighting the stories of twenty children in nine different families, all affected by reunification camps and the alienation industry, as well as current and prospective legislation designed to dismantle this for-profit, pyramid scheme:

1. **Zoe Winenger**: In this video, 10-year-old Zoe Winenger bravely speaks at a recent hearing for Piqui’s Law in California, where she describes her horrifying experience at the Family Bridges reunification camp, owned by Randy and Deidre Rand.

Shawn McCall is the parenting coordinator on this case and has been connected to many other stories of children being sent to reunification camps dating back as early as 2016. Lynn Steinberg’s testimony in this case was nothing short of disturbing but that is the case with most things that we uncover about Lynn Steinberg. On that same day, transport agents from Assisted Interventions Inc. testified about the methods that would be used to remove the children, their words and their actions were not in alignment. In an unexpected turn of events, Maya Laing released a video in the middle of the night on Monday, May 29, 2023. The video has been shared on Instagram, Facebook and TikTok. Maya and Sebastian have escaped, and their current whereabouts are unknown. In the video, they describe being called names like, “liars” and “psychopaths,” at the Los Angeles reunification camp.

According to the children, they were threatened with wilderness camp where they were warned that non-compliance would result in the removal of basic necessities such as food or blankets.

3. **[Orrin Ryder Homme and Camille Harley Joan Homme](https://www.onemomsbattle.com/blog/california-children-sent-to-family-bridges-reunification-camp)**: In December, 2022, we received a video of two children, Orrin Ryder Homme and Camille Harley Joan Homme, who were violently transported from Los Angeles to the Family Bridges reunification camp. The youngest child, Wolf, was transported separately. According to court orders, the two oldest children are not even living with their father but with their paternal grandparents. Camille and her mother, Brody Dalle, were both granted restraining orders against the children’s father, Josh Homme, who has a concerning history that is well-documented by media outlets. Despite the abuse findings and two restraining orders, Mr.
