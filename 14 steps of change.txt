To address the user's query, I have carefully reviewed the provided document, which outlines the "14 Steps of Change for an Abusive/Controlling Person" based on Lundy Bancroft's book "Why Does He Do That?". The task is to extract all text relevant to co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse, without abbreviating, and after thorough consideration. Below is the extracted text from the document that pertains directly or indirectly to these themes, presented as full steps for clarity and completeness.

The document is structured as a list of 14 steps, and while the primary focus is on the abuser's journey to change, several steps mention or imply interactions with partners and children, which are critical in the context of co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse. Co-parenting involves raising children together after separation, requiring mutual respect, accountability, and a focus on the children's well-being. Cooperation with a former spouse entails maintaining a functional relationship post-separation, often for the sake of shared responsibilities like parenting. Here are the relevant steps:

- **4. Recognize the short- and long-term effects the abuse had on you, any children or other victims, showing empathy for it.**  
  This step is relevant to co-parenting because it explicitly mentions "any children" as victims of the abuse. Recognizing the impact of past abusive behavior on children is a foundational aspect of effective co-parenting, as it demonstrates an awareness of their needs and well-being, which is essential for creating a safe and supportive environment.

- **7. Replace his/her distorted image of partner/children with a more positive respectful view. Understand that their partner/children are "for them" and not "against them".**  
  This step directly relates to both co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse. It addresses the need to shift negative perceptions of the "partner" (potentially a former spouse) and "children" to a positive, respectful view. Such a change in attitude is crucial for fostering cooperation with a former spouse and supporting a healthy co-parenting dynamic where both parties work together for the children's benefit.

- **8. Acknowledge and dismantle the thought processes that exaggerate their grievances against their partner or children.**  
  This step is also pertinent to co-parenting and cooperation. By dismantling exaggerated grievances against the "partner" (which could be a former spouse) and "children," the individual reduces conflict and blame, paving the way for a more collaborative relationship. This is particularly important in co-parenting, where minimizing hostility enhances the ability to make joint decisions for the children.

- **9. Make amends for the damage done. Develop a sense of debt owed.**  
  While this step does not explicitly mention the partner or children, it is implicitly relevant to co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse. Making amends for the damage caused by abuse likely includes actions directed toward those most affected, such as a former spouse and children. In a co-parenting context, this could involve apologies or reparative actions that rebuild trust and facilitate cooperation.

- **10. Accept the consequences of his/her actions, they should stop blaming others for the problems that are a result of the abuse.**  
  This step is significant for cooperation with a former spouse and indirectly for co-parenting. By accepting responsibility and ceasing to blame "others" (which could include a former spouse), the individual removes a major barrier to constructive communication and collaboration. This shift supports a more peaceful and cooperative relationship, essential for co-parenting arrangements.

- **14. Be willing to be accountable for his/her actions, both past and future, and share what the accountability plan includes with his/her partner.**  
  This step is directly relevant to cooperating with a former spouse and has implications for co-parenting. It emphasizes accountability and transparency by sharing an "accountability plan" with the "partner," who could be a former spouse in this context. This openness fosters trust and collaboration, key elements of successful co-parenting and post-separation cooperation.

### Explanation of Selection
These steps were selected because they either explicitly mention "partner" or "children" or have clear implications for the dynamics of co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse. For instance:
- Steps 4, 7, and 8 directly reference "children" and/or "partner," tying them to the effects of abuse and the need for changed attitudes, which are critical for co-parenting.
- Steps 7, 8, and 14 specifically involve the "partner," addressing perceptions, grievances, and accountabilityâ€”key factors in cooperating with a former spouse.
- Steps 9 and 10, while more general, imply actions and attitudes (making amends and accepting responsibility) that would directly influence interactions with a former spouse and the co-parenting relationship.

Other steps, such as Step 6 ("Replace those with healthy attitudes and behaviors based on respect") or Step 11 ("Commit to not repeating the abusive behaviors and honor that commitment, with no conditions"), are broadly important for personal change and could enhance co-parenting indirectly by promoting respect and safety. However, they do not specifically mention the partner or children, so they were excluded to focus on the most directly relevant text as per the query.

### Final Extracted Text
Here is the complete text extracted from the document that is relevant to co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse, presented in its original form without abbreviation:

- 4. Recognize the short- and long-term effects the abuse had on you, any children or other victims, showing empathy for it.
- 7. Replace his/her distorted image of partner/children with a more positive respectful view. Understand that their partner/children are "for them" and not "against them".
- 8. Acknowledge and dismantle the thought processes that exaggerate their grievances against their partner or children.
- 9. Make amends for the damage done. Develop a sense of debt owed.
- 10. Accept the consequences of his/her actions, they should stop blaming others for the problems that are a result of the abuse.
- 14. Be willing to be accountable for his/her actions, both past and future, and share what the accountability plan includes with his/her partner.

This text captures the aspects of the abuser's change process that most directly impact their ability to co-parent effectively and cooperate with a former spouse, fulfilling the requirements of the query.
