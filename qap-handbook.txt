### The Importance of Both Parents

"The Office of the Attorney General (OAG) believes that children do better when they have the love and support of both parents. Remember, you are a very important part of your child's life."

---

### Establishing Paternity as a Joint Effort

"Parents who are not married when a baby is born must establish paternity for their child to have a legal father. Unmarried couples can establish paternity by signing a legal document called an Acknowledgment of Paternity (AOP) or by petitioning the court. Both parents must voluntarily sign the form. Ordinarily, parents who agree on paternity and other terms of the order can establish child support in a meeting at a local child support office."

### Legal Processes Requiring Cooperation

"If you receive a court summons, go to court. If you cannot appear in court at the designated time, contact the court or child support office handling your case and ask how to file a response with the court. Opening a child support case with the OAG can protect your rights. A court order will be established that addresses custody and visitation, as well as how much child support and medical support you owe each month. Your case will be scheduled for a negotiation conference with the other parent in the child support office. If you and the other parent can't agree on issues like child support or visitation, the case will be set for court."

"Understand the consequences of signing a legal document before you sign. Once a legal document is signed and filed, it can be hard to change (sometimes impossible), and it is almost always expensive."

### Custody and Visitation

"In Texas, the law presumes that parents will be 'joint managing conservators,' meaning they will share parental rights and duties. The court may modify the Standard Possession Order based on the child's best interest. The court determines the child's best interest by considering factors such as the desires of the child, emotional and physical needs, parenting abilities, and stability of the home."

---

### Handling Changes in Circumstances

"If your child comes to live with you, notify your local child support office to request a change of status. Keep paying child support until the court orders that you are no longer required to do so. If your income changes and you are unable to pay your child support, notify the OAG and the court immediately. If both parents agree on a new amount, they may file a written agreement with the court."

"If you cannot pay the full amount one month, you should still pay something. A partial payment shows that you are making an effort. You should also call the child support office handling your case to explain your situation. It is unlikely that a court will consider direct payments to the child or the other parent as payment of child support."

---

### Separation of Child Support and Visitation

"If the child's other parent interferes with visitation, you must still pay your court-ordered child support. Legally, child support and visitation are separate issues. You have the right to see your child even if you are not paying child support, and you must continue to pay child support even if you are not seeing your child."
