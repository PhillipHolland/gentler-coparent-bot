a. The supreme court shall maintain uniform child support guidelines and criteria and
review the guidelines and criteria at least once every four years, pursuant to the federal Family
Support Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-485. The initial review shall be performed within four
years of October 12, 1989, and subsequently within the four-year period of the most recent
review.
b. The guidelines prescribed by the supreme court shall incorporate provisions for
medical support as defined in chapter 252E to be effective on or before January 1, 1991.
c. It is the intent of the general assembly that, to the extent possible within the
requirements of federal law, the court and child support services consider the individual
facts of each judgment or case in the application of the guidelines and determine the support
obligation accordingly . It is also the intent of the general assembly that in the supreme
court’s review of the guidelines, the supreme court shall do both of the following:
(1) Emphasize the ability of a court to apply the guidelines in a just and appropriate
manner based upon the individual facts of a judgment or case.
(2) In determining monthly child support payments, consider other children for whom
either parent is legally responsible for support and other child support obligations actually
paid by either party pursuant to a court or administrative order .
d. The guidelines prescribed by the supreme court shall be used by the department of
health and human services in determining child support payments under sections 252C.2 and
252C.4. A variation from the guidelines shall not be considered by the department without
a record or written finding, based on stated reasons, that the guidelines would be unjust or
inappropriate as determined under criteria prescribed by the supreme court.
2. Child support orders.
a. Court’s authority. Unless prohibited pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1738B, upon every
judgment of annulment, dissolution, or separate maintenance, the court may order either
parent or both parents to pay an amount reasonable and necessary for supporting a child.
b. Calculating amount of support.
(1) In establishing the amount of support, consideration shall be given to the responsibility
of both parents to support and provide for the welfare of the minor child and of a child’s need,
whenever practicable, for a close relationship with both parents.
(2) For purposes of calculating a support obligation under this section, the income of the
parent from whom support is sought shall be used as the noncustodial parent income for
purposes of application of the guidelines, regardless of the legal custody of the child.
(3) For the purposes of including a child’s dependent benefit in calculating a support

obligation under this section for a child whose parent has been awarded disability benefits
under the federal Social Security Act, the provisions of section 598.22C shall apply .
c. Rebuttable presumption in favor of guidelines. There shall be a rebuttable
presumption that the amount of child support which would result from the application of
the guidelines prescribed by the supreme court is the correct amount of child support to be
awarded.
d. Variation from guidelines. A variation from the guidelines shall not be considered by a
court without a record or written finding, based on stated reasons, that the guidelines would
be unjust or inappropriate as determined under the criteria prescribed by the supreme court.
e. Special circumstances justifying variation from guidelines. Unless the special
circumstances of the case justify a deviation, the court or child support services shall
establish a monthly child support payment in accordance with the guidelines for a parent
who is nineteen years of age or younger , who has not received a high school or high school
equivalency diploma, and to whom each of the following apply:
(1) The parent is attending a school or program described as follows or has been identified
as one of the following:
(a) The parent is in full-time attendance at an accredited school and is pursuing a course
of study leading to a high school diploma.
(b) The parent is attending an instructional program leading to a high school equivalency
diploma.
(c) The parent is attending a career and technical education program approved pursuant

to child support services, if child support services is providing services under chapter 252B,
or if child support services is not providing services pursuant to chapter 252B, to the court
as the court may direct. Failure to provide proof of compliance under this subparagraph or
proof of compliance under section 598.21G is grounds for modification of the support order
using the uniform child support guidelines and imputing an income to the parent equal to a
forty-hour workweek at the state minimum wage, unless the parent’s education, experience,
or actual earnings justify a higher income.
3. Medical support. The court shall order child medical support as provided in section
252E.1A. The premium cost of a health benefit plan may be considered by the court as a
reason for varying from the child support guidelines.
4. Necessary content of order . Orders made pursuant to this section need mention only
those factors relevant to the particular case for which the orders are made but shall contain
the names, birth dates, addresses, and counties of residence of the petitioner and respondent.

598.21C Modification of child, spousal, or medical support orders.
1. Criteria for modification. Subject to 28 U.S.C. §1738B, the court may subsequently

Tue Nov 19 20:05:24 2024 Iowa Code 2025, Chapter 598 (39, 1)§598.21C, DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE AND DOMESTIC RELATIONS 16
i. Changes in the physical, emotional, or educational needs of a child whose support is
governed by the order .
j. Contempt by a party of existing orders of court.
k. Entry of a dispositional or permanency order in juvenile court pursuant to chapter 232
placing custody or physical care of a child with a party who is obligated to pay support for
a child. Any filing fees or court costs for a modification filed or ordered pursuant to this
paragraph are waived.
l. Other factors the court determines to be relevant in an individual case.
2. Additional criteria for modification of child support orders.
a. Subject to 28 U.S.C. §1738B, but notwithstanding subsection 1, a substantial change of
circumstances exists when the court order for child support varies by ten percent or more
from the amount which would be due pursuant to the most current child support guidelines
established pursuant to section 598.21B or a parent has a health benefit plan available as
provided in section 252E.1A and the current order for support does not contain provisions
for medical support.
b. This basis for modification is applicable to petitions filed on or after July 1, 1992,
notwithstanding whether the guidelines prescribed by section 598.21B were used in
establishing the current amount of support. Upon application for a modification of an order
for child support for which services are being received pursuant to chapter 252B, the court
shall set the amount of child support based upon the most current child support guidelines
established pursuant to section 598.21B, including provisions for medical support pursuant
to chapter 252E. Child support services shall, in submitting an application for modification,
adjustment, or alteration of an order for support, employ additional criteria and procedures
as provided in chapter 252H and as established by rule.
3. Applicable law. Unless otherwise provided pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1738B, a
modification of a support order entered under chapter 234, 252A, 252C, 600B, this chapter,
or any other support chapter or proceeding between parties to the order is void unless the
modification is approved by the court, after proper notice and opportunity to be heard is
given to all parties to the order , and entered as an order of the court. If support payments
have been assigned to the department of health and human services pursuant to section
234.39, 239B.6, or 252E.11, or if services are being provided pursuant to chapter 252B,
the department is a party to the support order . Modifications of orders pertaining to child
custody shall be made pursuant to chapter 598B. If the petition for a modification of an order
pertaining to child custody asks either for joint custody or that joint custody be modified to
an award of sole custody , the modification, if any , shall be made pursuant to section 598.41.
4. Temporary modification of child support orders. While an application for modification
of a child support or child custody order is pending, the court may , on its own motion or upon
application by either party , enter a temporary order modifying an order of child support. The
court may enter such temporary order only after service of the original notice, and an order
shall not be entered until at least five days’ notice of hearing and opportunity to be heard, is
provided to all parties. In entering temporary orders under this subsection, the court shall
consider all pertinent matters, which may be demonstrated by affidavits, as the court may
direct. The hearing on application shall be limited to matters set forth in the application, the
affidavits of the parties, and any required statements of income. The court shall not hear
any other matter relating to the application for modification, respondent’s answer , or any
pleadings connected with the application for modification or the answer . This subsection
shall also apply to an order , decree, or judgment entered or pending on or before July 1, 2007,
and shall apply to an order entered under this chapter, chapter 252A, 252C, 252F, 252H, 252K,
or 600B, or any other applicable chapter of the Code.
5. Retroactivity of modification. Judgments for child support or child support awards
entered pursuant to this chapter, chapter 234, 252A, 252C, 252F, 600B, or any other chapter
of the Code which are subject to a modification proceeding may be retroactively modified
only from three months after the date the notice of the pending petition for modification is
served on the opposing party . The three-month limitation applies to a modification action
pending on or after July 1, 1997. The prohibition of retroactive modification does not bar
child support services from obtaining orders for accrued support for previous time periods.
Tue Nov 19 20:05:24 2024 Iowa Code 2025, Chapter 598 (39, 1)17 DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE AND DOMESTIC RELATIONS, §598.21E
Any retroactive modification which increases the amount of child support or any order for
accrued support under this subsection shall include a periodic payment plan. A retroactive
modification shall not be regarded as a delinquency unless there are subsequent failures to
make payments in accordance with the periodic payment plan.
6. Modification of periodic due date. The periodic due date established under a prior
order for payment of child support shall not be changed in any modified order under this
section, unless the court determines that good cause exists to change the periodic due date.
If the court determines that good cause exists, the court shall include the rationale for the
change in the modified order and shall address the issue of reconciliation of any payments
due or made under a prior order which would result in payment of the child support obligation
under both the prior and the modified orders.
7. Modification by child support services. Notwithstanding any other provision of law to
the contrary , when an application for modification or adjustment of support is submitted by
child support services, the sole issues which may be considered by the court in that action
are the application of the guidelines in establishing the amount of support pursuant to section
598.21B, and provision for medical support under chapter 252E. When an application for a
cost-of-living alteration of support is submitted by child support services pursuant to section
252H.24, the sole issue which may be considered by the court in the action is the application
of the cost-of-living alteration in establishing the amount of child support. Issues related to
custody , visitation, or other provisions unrelated to support shall be considered only under a
separate application for modification.
8. Necessary content of order . Orders made pursuant to this section need mention only
those factors relevant to the particular case for which the orders are made but shall contain
the names, birth dates, addresses, and counties of residence of the petitioner and respondent.
9. Duty of clerk of court. If the court modifies an order , and the original decree was
entered in another county in Iowa, the clerk of court shall send a copy of the modification by
regular mail, electronic transmission, or facsimile to the clerk of court for the county where
the original decree was entered.

598.21D Relocation of parent as grounds to modify order of child custody .
If a parent awarded joint legal custody and physical care or sole legal custody is relocating
the residence of the minor child to a location which is one hundred fifty miles or more
from the residence of the minor child at the time that custody was awarded, the court may
consider the relocation a substantial change in circumstances. If the court determines
that the relocation is a substantial change in circumstances, the court shall modify the
custody order to, at a minimum, preserve, as nearly as possible, the existing relationship
between the minor child and the nonrelocating parent. If modified, the order may include a
provision for extended visitation during summer vacations and school breaks and scheduled
telephone contact between the nonrelocating parent and the minor child. The modification
may include a provision assigning the responsibility for transportation of the minor child for
visitation purposes to either or both parents. If the court makes a finding of past interference
by the parent awarded joint legal custody and physical care or sole legal custody with the
minor child’s access to the other parent, the court may order the posting of a cash bond to
assure future compliance with the visitation provisions of the decree. The supreme court
shall prescribe guidelines for the forfeiting of the bond and restoration of the bond following
forfeiting of the bond.

medical support obligation may be established based upon a prior determination of paternity ,
Tue Nov 19 20:05:24 2024 Iowa Code 2025, Chapter 598 (39, 1)§598.21E, DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE AND DOMESTIC RELATIONS 18
a party wishes to contest the paternity of the child or children involved, all of the following
apply:
a. (1) If paternity has been legally established by one of the methods enumerated in
section 252A.3, subsection 10, or by operation of law due to the established father’s marriage
to the mother at the time of conception, birth, or at any time during the period between
conception and birth of the child, the provisions of section 600B.41A apply .
(2) If following the proceedings under section 600B.41A the court determines that the
prior determination of paternity should not be overcome, and that the established father
has a duty to provide support, the court shall enter an order establishing the monthly child
support payment and the amount of the support debt accrued and accruing pursuant to
section 598.21B, or the medical support obligation pursuant to chapter 252E, or both.
b. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, subparagraph (1), if a determination of paternity is
based on an administrative or court order or other means pursuant to the laws of another state
or foreign country as defined in chapter 252K, any action to overcome the prior determination
of paternity shall be filed in that jurisdiction. Unless a stay of the action initiated in this
state to establish child or medical support is requested and granted by the court, pending a
resolution of the contested paternity issue by the other state or foreign country as defined in
chapter 252K, the action shall proceed.
c. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, in a pending dissolution action under this chapter, a
prior determination of paternity by operation of law through the marriage of the established
father and mother of the child may be overcome under this chapter if the established father
and mother of the child file a written statement with the court that both parties agree that the
established father is not the biological father of the child.
2. If the court overcomes a prior determination of paternity , the previously established
father shall be relieved of support obligations as specified in section 600B.41A, subsection
5. In any action to overcome paternity other than through a pending dissolution action,
the provisions of section 600B.41A apply . Overcoming paternity under subsection 1,
paragraph “c”, does not bar subsequent actions to establish paternity . A subsequent
action to establish paternity against the previously established father is not barred if it is
subsequently determined that the written statement attesting that the established father is
not the biological father of the child may have been submitted erroneously , and that the
person previously determined not to be the child’s father during the dissolution action may
actually be the child’s biological father .
3. If an action to overcome paternity is brought pursuant to subsection 1, paragraph “c”,
the court shall appoint a guardian ad litem for the child for the pendency of the proceedings.

598.21F Postsecondary education subsidy .
1. Order of subsidy. The court may order a postsecondary education subsidy if good
cause is shown.
2. Criteria for good cause. In determining whether good cause exists for ordering a
postsecondary education subsidy , the court shall consider the age of the child, the ability of
the child relative to postsecondary education, the child’s financial resources, whether the
child is self-sustaining, and the financial condition of each parent. If the court determines
that good cause is shown for ordering a postsecondary education subsidy , the court shall
determine the amount of subsidy as follows:

attending an in-state public institution for a course of instruction leading to an undergraduate
degree and shall include the reasonable costs for only necessary postsecondary education
expenses.

and the ability of the child to earn income while attending school.

598.41 Custody of children.
1. a. The court may provide for joint custody of the child by the parties. The court, insofar
as is reasonable and in the best interest of the child, shall order the custody award, including
liberal visitation rights where appropriate, which will assure the child the opportunity for the
maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents after the parents have
separated or dissolved the marriage, and which will encourage parents to share the rights and
responsibilities of raising the child unless direct physical harm or significant emotional harm
to the child, other children, or a parent is likely to result from such contact with one parent.
b. Notwithstanding paragraph “a”, if the court finds that a history of domestic abuse
exists, a rebuttable presumption against the awarding of joint custody exists.
c. The court shall consider the denial by one parent of the child’s opportunity for
maximum continuing contact with the other parent, without just cause, a significant factor
in determining the proper custody arrangement. Just cause may include a determination by
the court pursuant to subsection 3, paragraph “j”, that a history of domestic abuse exists
between the parents.
d. If a history of domestic abuse exists as determined by a court pursuant to subsection
3, paragraph “j”, and if a parent who is a victim of such domestic abuse relocates or is absent
from the home based upon the fear of or actual acts or threats of domestic abuse perpetrated
by the other parent, the court shall not consider the relocation or absence of that parent as a
factor against that parent in the awarding of custody or visitation.
e. Unless otherwise ordered by the court in the custody decree, both parents shall have
legal access to information concerning the child, including but not limited to medical,
educational and law enforcement records.
2. a. On the application of either parent, the court shall consider granting joint custody
in cases where the parents do not agree to joint custody .
b. If the court does not grant joint custody under this subsection, the court shall cite
clear and convincing evidence, pursuant to the factors in subsection 3, that joint custody is
unreasonable and not in the best interest of the child to the extent that the legal custodial
relationship between the child and a parent should be severed.
c. A finding by the court that a history of domestic abuse exists, as specified in subsection
3, paragraph “j”, which is not rebutted, shall outweigh consideration of any other factor
specified in subsection 3 in the determination of the awarding of custody under this
subsection.
d. Before ruling upon the joint custody petition in these cases, unless the court determines
that a history of domestic abuse exists as specified in subsection 3, paragraph “j”, or unless
the court determines that direct physical harm or significant emotional harm to the child,
other children, or a parent is likely to result, the court may require the parties to participate in
custody mediation to determine whether joint custody is in the best interest of the child. The
court may require the child’s participation in the mediation insofar as the court determines
the child’s participation is advisable.

e. The costs of custody mediation shall be paid in full or in part by the parties and taxed
as court costs.
3. In considering what custody arrangement under subsection 2 is in the best interest of
the minor child, the court shall consider the following factors:
a. Whether each parent would be a suitable custodian for the child.
b. Whether the psychological and emotional needs and development of the child will
suffer due to lack of active contact with and attention from both parents.
c. Whether the parents can communicate with each other regarding the child’s needs.
d. Whether both parents have actively cared for the child before and since the separation.
e. Whether each parent can support the other parent’s relationship with the child.
f. Whether the custody arrangement is in accord with the child’s wishes or whether the
child has strong opposition, taking into consideration the child’s age and maturity .
g. Whether one or both of the parents agree or are opposed to joint custody .
h. The geographic proximity of the parents.
i. Whether the safety of the child, other children, or the other parent will be jeopardized
by the awarding of joint custody or by unsupervised or unrestricted visitation.
j. Whether a history of domestic abuse, as defined in section 236.2, exists. In determining
whether a history of domestic abuse exists, the court’s consideration shall include but is not
limited to commencement of an action pursuant to section 236.3, the issuance of a protective
order against the parent or the issuance of a court order or consent agreement pursuant to
section 236.5, the issuance of an emergency order pursuant to section 236.6, the holding of
a parent in contempt pursuant to section 664A.7, the response of a peace officer to the scene
of alleged domestic abuse or the arrest of a parent following response to a report of alleged
domestic abuse, or a conviction for domestic abuse assault pursuant to section 708.2A.
k. Whether a parent has allowed a person custody or control of, or unsupervised access
to a child after knowing the person is required to register or is on the sex offender registry
as a sex offender under chapter 692A.
4. Subsection 3 shall not apply when parents agree to joint custody .
5. a. If joint legal custody is awarded to both parents, the court may award joint physical
care to both joint custodial parents upon the request of either parent. Prior to ruling on the
request for the award of joint physical care, the court may require the parents to submit,
either individually or jointly , a proposed joint physical care parenting plan. A proposed joint
physical care parenting plan shall address how the parents will make decisions affecting the
child, how the parents will provide a home for the child, how the child’s time will be divided
between the parents and how each parent will facilitate the child’s time with the other parent,
arrangements in addition to court-ordered child support for the child’s expenses, how the
parents will resolve major changes or disagreements affecting the child including changes
that arise due to the child’s age and developmental needs, and any other issues the court
may require. If the court denies the request for joint physical care, the determination shall
be accompanied by specific findings of fact and conclusions of law that the awarding of joint
physical care is not in the best interest of the child.
b. If joint physical care is not awarded under paragraph “a”, and only one joint custodial
parent is awarded physical care, the parent responsible for providing physical care shall
support the other parent’s relationship with the child. Physical care awarded to one parent
does not affect the other parent’s rights and responsibilities as a joint legal custodian of the
child. Rights and responsibilities as joint legal custodian of the child include but are not
limited to equal participation in decisions affecting the child’s legal status, medical care,
education, extracurricular activities, and religious instruction.
6. If the parties have more than one minor child, and the court awards each party the
physical custody of one or more of the children, upon application by either party , and if it is
reasonable and in the best interest of the children, the court shall include a provision in the
custody order directing the parties to allow visitation between the children in each party’s
custody .
7. When a parent awarded legal custody or physical care of a child cannot act as custodian
or caretaker because the parent has died or has been judicially adjudged incompetent, the
Tue Nov 19 20:05:24 2024 Iowa Code 2025, Chapter 598 (39, 1)29 DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE AND DOMESTIC RELATIONS, §598.41C
court shall award legal custody including physical care of the child to the surviving parent
unless the court finds that such an award is not in the child’s best interest.
8. If an application for modification of a decree or a petition for modification of an order
is filed, based upon differences between the parents regarding the custody arrangement
established under the decree or order , unless the court determines that a history of domestic
abuse exists as specified in subsection 3, paragraph “j”, or unless the court determines that
direct physical harm or significant emotional harm to the child, other children, or a parent
is likely to result, the court may require the parents to participate in mediation to attempt to
resolve the differences between the parents.
9. All orders relating to custody of a child are subject to chapter 598B.
