TITLE 32
DOMESTIC RELATIONS
CHAPTER 7
DIVORCE ACTIONS
32-701. RESIDENCE REQUIRED BY PLAINTIFF. A divorce must not be granted
unless the plaintiff has been a resident of the state for six (6) full weeks
next preceding the commencement of the action.

94, sec. 1, p. 131.]
32-702. DOMICIL OF PARTIES. In actions for divorce the presumption of
law that the domicil of the husband is the domicil of the wife, does not ap-
ply. After separation each may have a separate domicil, depending for proof
upon actual residence, and not upon legal presumptions.
[(32-702) R.S., sec. 2470; reen. R.C. & C.L., sec. 2660; C.S., sec.
4640; I.C.A., sec. 31-702.]
32-703. DEFAULT AND UNCORROBORATED STATEMENTS. A divorce may be
granted upon the default of the defendant, upon the uncorroborated state-
ment, admission or testimony of the plaintiff.

32-704. ALLOWANCE OF SUPPORT MONEY, COURT COSTS AND ATTORNEY FEES
-- REPRESENTATION OF CHILD. 1. While an action for divorce is pending,
the court may, in its discretion, on the motion of either party and upon
showing made in conformity with section 32-705 or section 32-706, Idaho
Code, whichever be appropriate, order the payment of temporary maintenance
of either spouse by the other or temporary support of a child of the marriage,
in amounts and on terms just and proper under the circumstances.
2. The court may, in its discretion, on the motion of either party enter
a decree of legal separation, providing for custody of children, division of
property, payment of debts, payment of child support, and payment of spousal
support as set forth in the statutes governing domestic relations.
3. The court may from time to time after considering the financial re-
sources of both parties and the factors set forth in section 32-705, Idaho
Code, order a party to pay a reasonable amount for the cost to the other party
of maintaining or defending any proceeding under this act and for attorney's
fees, including sums for legal services rendered and costs incurred prior to
the commencement of the proceeding or after entry of judgment. The court may
order that the amount be paid directly to the attorney, who may enforce the
order in his name.
4. The court may appoint an attorney or guardian ad litem to represent
the interests of a minor or dependent child with respect to his or her sup-
port, custody, and visitation, but only in those instances where the court
deems legal representation or other assistance is necessary beyond any court2
ordered and court related services previously authorized for the particular
case. The court shall enter an order for costs, fees, and disbursements in
favor of the child's attorney or guardian ad litem. The order shall be made
against either or both parents, except, if both parties are indigent, the
costs, fees, and disbursements shall be borne by the county in which the ac-
tion is pending.

p. 815.]
32-705. MAINTENANCE. 1. Where a divorce is decreed, the court may grant
a maintenance order if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance:
(a) Lacks sufficient property to provide for his or her reasonable
needs; and
(b) Is unable to support himself or herself through employment.
2. The maintenance order shall be in such amounts and for such periods
of time that the court deems just, after considering all relevant factors
which may include:
(a) The financial resources of the spouse seeking maintenance, includ-
ing the marital property apportioned to said spouse, and said spouse's
ability to meet his or her needs independently;
(b) The time necessary to acquire sufficient education and training to
enable the spouse seeking maintenance to find employment;
(c) The duration of the marriage;
(d) The age and the physical and emotional condition of the spouse seek-
ing maintenance;
(e) The ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought to meet
his or her needs while meeting those of the spouse seeking maintenance;
(f) The tax consequences to each spouse;
(g) The fault of either party.
[32-705, added 1980, ch. 378, sec. 4, p. 963; am. 1990, ch. 336, sec.
1, p. 917.]
32-706. CHILD SUPPORT. (1) In a proceeding for divorce or child sup-
port, the court may order either or both parents owing a duty of support to a
child to pay an amount reasonable or necessary for his or her support and edu-
cation until the child is eighteen (18) years of age, without regard to mari-
tal misconduct, after considering all relevant factors which may include:
(a) The financial resources of the child;
(b) The financial resources, needs, and obligations of both the custo-
dial and noncustodial parents which ordinarily shall not include a par-
ent's community property interest in the financial resources or obli-
gations of a spouse who is not a parent of the child, unless compelling
reasons exist;
(c) The standard of living the child enjoyed during the marriage;
(d) The physical and emotional condition and needs of the child and his
or her educational needs;
(e) The availability of medical coverage for the child at reasonable
cost as defined in section 32-1214B, Idaho Code; and
(f) The actual tax benefit recognized by the party claiming the federal
child dependency exemption.3
(2) If the child continues his high school education subsequent to
reaching the age of eighteen (18) years, the court may, in its discretion,
and after considering all relevant factors which include those set forth in
subsection (1) of this section, order the continuation of support payments
until the child discontinues his high school education or reaches the age of
nineteen (19) years, whichever is sooner.
(3) All child support orders shall notify the obligor that the order
will be enforced by income withholding pursuant to chapter 12, title 32,
Idaho Code. Failure to include this provision does not affect the validity
of the support order. The court shall require that the social security
numbers of both the obligor and obligee be included in the order or decree.
(4) In a proceeding for the support of a child or a minor parent, the
court may order the parent(s) of each minor parent to pay an amount reason-
able or necessary for the support and education of the child born to the minor
parent(s) until the minor parent is eighteen (18) years of age, after consid-
ering all relevant factors which may include:
(a) The financial resources of the child;
(b) The financial resources of the minor parent;
(c) The financial resources, needs and obligations of the parent of the
minor parent;
(d) The physical and emotional condition and needs of the child and his
or her educational needs; and
(e) The availability of medical coverage for the child at reasonable
cost as defined in section 32-1214B, Idaho Code.
(5) The legislature hereby authorizes and encourages the supreme court
of the state of Idaho to adopt and to periodically review for modification
guidelines that utilize and implement the factors set forth in subsections
(1) through (4) of this section to create a uniform procedure for reaching
fair and adequate child support awards. There shall be a rebuttable pre-
sumption that the amount of the award which would result from the applica-
tion of the guidelines is the amount of child support to be awarded, unless
evidence is presented in a particular case that indicates that an applica-
tion of the guidelines would be unjust or inappropriate. If the court de-
termines that circumstances exist to permit a departure from the guidelines,
the judge making the determination shall make a written or specific finding
on the record that the application of the guidelines would be unjust or in-
appropriate in the particular case before the court. When adopting guide-
lines, the supreme court shall provide that in a proceeding to modify an ex-
isting award, children of the party requesting the modification who are born
or adopted after the entry of the existing order shall not be considered.
(6) If the court awards one (1) parent the right to claim tax benefits
associated with his child or children, the court order need not list every
applicable tax benefit. The parent who was awarded the tax benefits for
the child or children shall attach a copy of the court order to his income
tax return. The state tax commission shall recognize the award of tax
benefits with respect to the child or children as applying to the child tax
credit under section 63-3029L, Idaho Code, the food tax credit under section
63-3024A, Idaho Code, and any and all other state and federal tax deductions,
exemptions, and credits for which the parent qualifies, unless the court
order specifies otherwise.

32-707. SECURITY. The court may require reasonable security for pro-
viding maintenance or making any payments required under the provisions of
this chapter, and may enforce the same by the appointment of a receiver, or by
any other remedy applicable to the case.
[(32-707) R.S., sec. 2475; reen. R.C. & C.L., sec. 2665; C.S., sec.

32-708. WHAT PROPERTY LIABLE. When implementing and construing sec-
tions 32-705 through 32-707, Idaho Code, the court must resort, first, to the
community property, then to the separate property of either party.
[(32-708) R.S., sec. 2476; reen. R.C. & C.L., sec. 2666; C.S., sec.

32-709. MODIFICATION OF PROVISIONS FOR MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT. (1)
The provisions of any decree respecting maintenance or support may be
modified only as to installments accruing subsequent to the motion for
modification and only upon a showing of a substantial and material change of
circumstances.
(2) The court may allow a credit against child support arrearages for
periods of time exceeding one hundred twenty (120) days during which the mi-
nor children have lived primarily with the obligated parent with the knowl-
edge and consent of the custodial parent.
[32-709, added 1980, ch. 378, sec. 8, p. 964; am. 2003, ch. 246, sec.

32-710A. SUPPORT PAYMENTS PAID TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND WEL-
FARE. A. Effective October 1, 1998, all payments for child support ordered
pursuant to any decree of divorce or other order for support shall be paid,
unless otherwise ordered by the court, to the department of health and wel-
fare. The department shall keep a record of payments made under said order
or decree and shall, within two (2) business days of receipt of such payment,
transmit said payments to the person or persons entitled thereto by virtue
of said order or decree. Whenever a child is in the physical care of a person
or entity other than its parents and the department of health and welfare
is providing child support services under title IV-D of the social security
act, the department may, after written notice to the obligor and obligee and
the opportunity for hearing set forth in paragraphs 1. through 3. of this
subsection transmit payments under an order of support for said child to the
person or entity who has physical care of said child, without further order
of the court, whether or not such person or entity is the obligee under the
support order.
1. The department shall send notice of its intent to transmit child sup-
port payments to the person or entity who has physical care of the child
by registered or certified mail to the last known address of the obligor
and obligee under an order for support of the child.
2. The obligor and obligee may file a written objection to the transmit-
tal of child support payments with a court of proper jurisdiction within
fourteen (14) days from the date the notice of transmittal is mailed. A5
copy of the written objection shall be sent to the department of health
and welfare.
3. After hearing in a court of proper jurisdiction and entry of an or-
der, or if no written objection is made by the obligor or obligee, the
department may transmit the payments under an order of support for the
child to the person or entity who has physical care of the child.
B. Any person entitled to receive child support payments pursuant to
any decree of divorce or other order for support may make application for
enforcement services to the department of health and welfare as provided in
section 56-203A, Idaho Code, when child support is not being paid as ordered.
C. All child support orders shall provide that the order will be en-
forced by income withholding pursuant to chapter 12, title 32, Idaho Code.
Failure to include this provision does not affect the validity of the support
order or decree. The court shall require that the social security numbers of
both the obligor and obligee be included in the order or decree.

32-712. COMMUNITY PROPERTY AND HOMESTEAD -- DISPOSITION. In case of di-
vorce by the decree of a court of competent jurisdiction, the community prop-
erty and the homestead must be assigned as follows:
1. The community property must be assigned by the court in such propor-
tions as the court, from all the facts of the case and the condition of the
parties, deems just, with due consideration of the following factors:
(a) Unless there are compelling reasons otherwise, there shall be a
substantially equal division in value, considering debts, between the
spouses.
(b) Factors which may bear upon whether a division shall be equal, or
the manner of division, include, but are not limited to:
(1) Duration of the marriage;
(2) Any antenuptial agreement of the parties; provided, however,
that the court shall have no authority to amend or rescind any such
agreement;
(3) The age, health, occupation, amount and source of income, vo-
cational skills, employability, and liabilities of each spouse;
(4) The needs of each spouse;
(5) Whether the apportionment is in lieu of or in addition to main-
tenance;
(6) The present and potential earning capability of each party;
and
(7) Retirement benefits, including, but not limited to, social
security, civil service, military and railroad retirement bene-
fits.
2. If a homestead has been selected from the community property, it may
be assigned to either party, either absolutely, provided such assignment is
considered in distribution of the community property, or for a limited pe-
riod, subject in the latter case to the future disposition of the court; or it
may be divided or be sold and the proceeds divided.
3. If a homestead has been selected from the separate property of ei-
ther, it must be assigned to the former owner of such property, subject to the
power of the court to assign it for a limited period to the other spouse.6

32-713. COMMUNITY PROPERTY AND HOMESTEAD -- ORDER FOR DISPOSITION. The
court, in rendering a decree of divorce, must make such order for the dis-
position of the community property, and of the homestead as in this chapter
provided, and, whenever necessary for that purpose, may order a partition or
sale of the property and a division or other disposition of the proceeds.

32-714. COMMUNITY PROPERTY AND HOMESTEAD -- REVISION ON APPEAL. The
disposition of the community property, and of the homestead, as above
provided, is subject to revision on appeal in all particulars, including
those which are stated to be in the discretion of the court.

32-715. JURISDICTION OF ACTIONS. Exclusive original jurisdiction of
all actions and proceedings under this chapter is in the district court, but
a judge thereof at chambers may make all necessary orders to carry out the
provisions of this chapter. The powers and jurisdiction granted district
judges shall apply to proceedings under this chapter.

1, p. 357; am. 2022, ch. 25, sec. 1, p. 71.]
32-716. RECONCILIATION PROCEEDINGS. No hearing on the merits upon
grounds for divorce shall be held in any action for divorce, and no final de-
cree of a court of competent jurisdiction shall be entered in any such case,
except as hereinafter provided, until at least twenty-one (21) days after
the commencement of the action and service of process. During such period of
twenty-one (21) days, or at any time subsequent and prior to entry of final
decree therein, the court, upon application of one (1) of the parties, may
require a conference of the parties with a person or persons of his choosing,
or persons selected by the court, in order to determine whether or not a
reconciliation between the parties is practicable; provided, however, that
nothing herein shall prevent the court from making such interim orders as may
be just and equitable; provided, further, that nothing herein shall prevent
the court from proceeding to try the matter on the merits and enter a final
decree of divorce upon the agreement of both parties and with both parties
present in person or represented by counsel at such trial.
In any action of divorce where grounds for divorce have been estab-
lished, if the court finds that attempts at reconciliation are practicable
and to the best interest of the family, the court may stay the proceedings for
a period not to exceed ninety (90) days where there are minor children in the
family.
The reconciliation procedures herein provided shall not be construed
as a condonation on the part of either spouse of acts that may constitute
grounds for divorce.7
[I.C., sec. 32-716, as added by 1971, ch. 21, sec. 1, p. 34; am. 2019,
ch. 28, sec. 1, p. 76.]
32-717. CUSTODY OF CHILDREN -- BEST INTEREST. (1) In an action for di-
vorce the court may, before and after judgment, give such direction for the
custody, care and education of the children of the marriage as may seem nec-
essary or proper in the best interests of the children. The court shall con-
sider all relevant factors which may include:
(a) The wishes of the child's parent or parents as to his or her custody;
(b) The wishes of the child as to his or her custodian;
(c) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his or her
parent or parents, and his or her siblings;
(d) The child's adjustment to his or her home, school, and community;
(e) The character and circumstances of all individuals involved;
(f) The need to promote continuity and stability in the life of the
child; and
(g) Domestic violence as defined in section 39-6303, Idaho Code,
whether or not in the presence of the child.
(2) If the parent has a disability as defined in this section, the par-
ent shall have the right to provide evidence and information regarding the
manner in which the use of adaptive equipment or supportive services will en-
able the parent to carry out the responsibilities of parenting the child.
The court shall advise the parent of such right. Evaluations of parental
fitness shall take into account the use of adaptive equipment and support-
ive services for parents with disabilities and shall be conducted by, or with
the assistance of, a person who has expertise concerning such equipment and
services. Nothing in this section shall be construed to create any new or
additional obligations on state or local governments to purchase or provide
adaptive equipment or supportive services for parents with disabilities.
(3) In any case where the child is actually residing with a grandparent
in a stable relationship, the court may recognize the grandparent as having
the same standing as a parent for evaluating what custody arrangements are in
the best interests of the child.
(4) As used in this chapter:
(a) "Adaptive equipment" means any piece of equipment or any item that
is used to increase, maintain or improve the parenting capabilities of a
parent with a disability.
(b) "Disability" means, with respect to an individual, any mental
or physical impairment which substantially limits one (1) or more
major life activities of the individual including, but not limited to,
self-care, manual tasks, walking, seeing, hearing, speaking, learning
or working, or a record of such an impairment, or being regarded as
having such an impairment. Disability shall not include transvestism,
transsexualism, pedophilia, exhibitionism, voyeurism, other sexual
behavior disorders, substance use disorders, compulsive gambling,
kleptomania or pyromania. Sexual preference or orientation is not
considered an impairment or disability. Whether an impairment sub-
stantially limits a major life activity shall be determined without
consideration of the effect of corrective or mitigating measures used
to reduce the effects of the impairment.
(c) "Supportive services" means services which assist a parent with a
disability to compensate for those aspects of their disability which
affect their ability to care for their child and which will enable8
them to discharge their parental responsibilities. The term includes
specialized or adapted training, evaluations, or assistance with
effective use of adaptive equipment, and accommodations which allow a
parent with a disability to benefit from other services, such as braille
texts or sign language interpreters.
(5) Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to allow discrimination
on the basis of disability. In any case where the disability of a parent is
found by the court to be relevant to an award of custody of a child, the court
shall make specific findings concerning the disability and what effect, if
any, the court finds the disability has on the best interests of the child.
(6) With reference to this section, when an active member of the Idaho
national guard has been ordered or called to duty as defined in section
46-409, Idaho Code, or when a member of the military reserve is ordered to
active federal service under title 10, United States Code, such military
service thereunder shall not be a substantial or material and permanent
change in circumstance to modify by reducing the member's previously decreed
child custody and visitation privileges.

32-717A. PARENTS' ACCESS TO RECORDS AND INFORMATION. Notwithstanding
any other provisions of law, access to records and information pertaining to
a minor child including, but not limited to, medical, dental, health, and
school or educational records, shall not be denied to a parent because the
parent is not the child's custodial parent. However, information concerning
the minor child's address shall be deleted from such records to a parent, if
the custodial parent has advised the records custodian in writing to do so.
[32-717A, added 1982, ch. 311, sec. 2, p. 776; am. 1998, ch. 151, sec.
1, p. 522.]
32-717B. JOINT CUSTODY. (1) "Joint custody" means an order awarding
custody of the minor child or children to both parents and providing that
physical custody shall be shared by the parents in such a way as to assure
the child or children of frequent and continuing contact with both parents.
The court may award either joint physical custody or joint legal custody or
both as between the parents or parties as the court determines is for the best
interests of the minor child or children. If the court declines to enter
an order awarding joint custody, the court shall state in its decision the
reasons for denial of an award of joint custody.
(2) "Joint physical custody" means an order awarding each of the par-
ents significant periods of time in which a child resides with or is under the
care and supervision of each of the parents or parties.
Joint physical custody shall be shared by the parents in such a way to
assure the child a frequent and continuing contact with both parents but does
not necessarily mean the child's time with each parent should be exactly the
same in length nor does it necessarily mean the child should be alternating
back and forth over certain periods of time between each parent.
The actual amount of time with each parent shall be determined by the
court.9
(3) "Joint legal custody" means a judicial determination that the par-
ents or parties are required to share the decision-making rights, responsi-
bilities and authority relating to the health, education and general welfare
of a child or children.
(4) Except as provided in subsection (5), of this section, absent a pre-
ponderance of the evidence to the contrary, there shall be a presumption that
joint custody is in the best interests of a minor child or children.
(5) There shall be a presumption that joint custody is not in the best
interests of a minor child if one (1) of the parents is found by the court
to be a habitual perpetrator of domestic violence as defined in section
39-6303, Idaho Code.
[32-717B, added 1982, ch. 311, sec. 3, p. 776; am. 1994, ch. 340, sec.
2, p. 1076.]
32-717C. ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE -- INVESTIGATION. When, in any divorce
proceeding or upon request for modification of a divorce decree, an allega-
tion of child abuse or child sexual abuse is made, implicating either party,
the court shall order that an investigation be conducted by the department of
health and welfare. A final award of custody or visitation may not be ren-
dered until a report on that investigation is received by the court. That
investigation shall be conducted by the department within thirty (30) days
of the court's notice and request for investigation.
[32-717C, added 1995, ch. 275, sec. 1, p. 923.]
32-717D. PARENTING COORDINATOR. (1) Provided that a court has entered
a judgment or an order establishing child custody in a case, the court may

der is filed during the time that the court action may be subject to the ser-
vicemembers civil relief act, 50 U.S.C. App. section 501 et seq., because

the court shall thereafter act in compliance with the terms of said act and,
in addition, the following shall apply to the extent not in violation of said
act:

order or decree temporarily modifying the existing child custody order
during the period of deployment, and upon completion by the servicemem-
ber of the period of deployment, the order or decree shall expire sixty
(60) days after notification to the court, and to all persons entitled
to notice in the action, of the deployed servicemember's completion of
deployment. Provided however, that:
(i) The court may thereafter conduct an expedited or emergency
hearing for resolution of the child's custody on the filing of a
motion, filed prior to the expiration of the order, alleging that
it would not be in the best interests of the child pursuant to the
provisions of section 32-717, Idaho Code, if the order expires;
(ii) If a motion is so filed, the temporary order shall be extended
until the court rules on the motion; and
(iii) Following the return from deployment of a deploying parent
and until the temporary order for child custody is terminated, the
court shall enter a temporary order granting the deploying par-
ent reasonable contact with the child unless it is contrary to the

32-717, Idaho Code.
(b) If the deployment of a party who is a servicemember affects the
party's ability or anticipated ability to appear at a regularly sched-
uled hearing related to a petition for modification of child custody,
the court may provide for an expedited hearing to allow the servicemem-
ber to appear.
(c) If the deployment of a party who is a servicemember prevents the
servicemember from appearing in person at a hearing related to a pe-
tition for the modification of child custody, the court may provide,
upon reasonable advance notice to the parties, for the servicemember to
present testimony and evidence by electronic means, if such can be done
without prejudice to the ability of the servicemember to adequately and
reasonably present such testimony and evidence.
