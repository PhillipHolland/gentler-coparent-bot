valuation under section 518.58, subdivision 1. All property acquired by either spouse subsequent to the
marriage and before the valuation date is presumed to be marital property regardless of whether title is held
individually or by the spouses in a form of co-ownership such as joint tenancy, tenancy in common, tenancy
by the entirety, or community property. Each spouse shall be deemed to have a common ownership in marital
property that vests not later than the time of the entry of the decree in a proceeding for dissolution or
annulment. The extent of the vested interest shall be determined and made final by the court pursuant to
section 518.58. If a title interest in real property is held individually by only one spouse, the interest in the
real property of the nontitled spouse is not subject to claims of creditors or judgment or tax liens until the
time of entry of the decree awarding an interest to the nontitled spouse. The presumption of marital property
is overcome by a showing that the property is nonmarital property.
"Nonmarital property" means property real or personal, acquired by either spouse before, during, or
after the existence of their marriage, which
(a) is acquired as a gift, bequest, devise or inheritance made by a third party to one but not to the other

determined under the terms of the laws or other plan document provisions governing the plan, including
section 356.30.
Subd. 7. Private pension plan. "Private pension plan" means a plan, fund, or program maintained by
an employer or employee organization that provides retirement income to employees or results in a deferral
of income by employees for a period extending to the termination of covered employment or beyond.
Subd. 8. Public pension plan. "Public pension plan" means a pension plan or fund specified in section
356.20, subdivision 2, or 356.30, subdivision 3, the deferred compensation plan specified in section 352.965,

maintained, or supported by a governmental subdivision or public body whose revenues are derived from
taxation, fees, assessments, or from other public sources.

which the party has no present intention of moving.

518.01 VOID MARRIAGES.
All marriages which are prohibited by section 517.03 shall be absolutely void, without any decree of
dissolution or other legal proceedings; except if a person whose spouse has been absent for four successive
years, without being known to the person to be living during that time, marries during the lifetime of the
absent spouse, the marriage shall be void only from the time that its nullity is duly adjudged. If the absentee
is declared dead in accordance with section 578.17, the subsequent marriage shall not be void.

Revisor of Statutes5
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.055
(a) A party lacked capacity to consent to the marriage at the time the marriage was solemnized, either
because of mental incapacity or infirmity and the other party at the time the marriage was solemnized did

or because consent of either was obtained by force or fraud and there was no subsequent voluntary cohabitation
of the parties;
(b) A party lacks the physical capacity to consummate the marriage by sexual intercourse and the other
party at the time the marriage was solemnized did not know of the incapacity;
(c) A party was under the age for marriage established by section 517.02.

518.03 ACTION TO ANNUL; DECREE.

518.04 INSUFFICIENT GROUNDS FOR ANNULMENT.
No marriage shall be adjudged a nullity on the ground that one of the parties was under the age of legal
consent if it appears that the parties had voluntarily cohabited together as spouses after having attained such

after restoration to reason, if it appears that the parties freely cohabited together as spouses after such
restoration.

518.05 ANNULMENT; WHEN TO BRING.
An annulment may be sought by any of the following persons and must be commenced within the times
specified, but in no event may an annulment be sought after the death of either party to the marriage:
(a) for a reason set forth in section 518.02, clause (a), by either party or by the legal representative of
the party who lacked capacity to consent, no later than 90 days after the petitioner obtained knowledge of
the described condition;
(b) for the reason set forth in section 518.02, clause (b), by either party no later than one year after the
petitioner obtained knowledge of the described condition;
(c) for the reason set forth in section 518.02, clause (c), by the underaged party, the party's parent or
guardian, before the time the underaged party reaches the age at which the party could have married without
satisfying the omitted requirement.

518.055 PUTATIVE SPOUSE.
Any person who has cohabited with another to whom the person is not legally married in the good faith
belief that the person was married to the other is a putative spouse until knowledge of the fact that the person

Revisor of Statutes518.055
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
6
is not legally married terminates the status and prevents acquisition of further rights. A putative spouse
acquires the rights conferred upon a legal spouse, including the right to maintenance following termination
of the status, whether or not the marriage is prohibited or declared a nullity. If there is a legal spouse or other
putative spouses, rights acquired by a putative spouse do not supersede the rights of the legal spouse or those
acquired by other putative spouses, but the court shall apportion property, maintenance, and support rights
among the claimants as appropriate in the circumstances and in the interests of justice.
History: 1978 c 772 s 21; 1986 c 444
PROCEEDINGS
518.06 DISSOLUTION OF MARRIAGE; LEGAL SEPARATION; GROUNDS; UNCONTESTED
LEGAL SEPARATION.
Subdivision 1. Meaning and effect; grounds. A dissolution of marriage is the termination of the marital
relationship between spouses. A decree of dissolution completely terminates the marital status of both parties.
A legal separation is a court determination of the rights and responsibilities of a husband and wife arising
out of the marital relationship. A decree of legal separation does not terminate the marital status of the parties.
A dissolution of a marriage shall be granted by a county or district court when the court finds that there has
been an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage relationship.
A decree of legal separation shall be granted when the court finds that one or both parties need a legal
separation.
Defenses to divorce, dissolution and legal separation, including but not limited to condonation,
connivance, collusion, recrimination, insanity, and lapse of time, are abolished.
Subd. 2. [Repealed, 1978 c 772 s 63]
Subd. 3. Uncontested legal separation. If one or both parties petition for a decree of legal separation
and neither party contests the granting of the decree nor petitions for a decree of dissolution, the court shall
grant a decree of legal separation.

518.07 RESIDENCE OF PARTIES.
Subdivision 1. General. Except as provided in subdivision 2, no dissolution shall be granted unless:
(1) one of the parties has resided in this state, or has been a member of the armed services stationed in
this state, for not less than 180 days immediately preceding the commencement of the proceeding; or
(2) one of the parties has been a domiciliary of this state for not less than 180 days immediately preceding
commencement of the proceeding.
Subd. 2. Action for dissolution by certain nonresidents. (a) If neither party to the civil marriage is a
resident of this state at the commencement of the proceeding, a court of this state has jurisdiction over the
dissolution if:
(1) the civil marriage was performed in this state; and
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes7
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.091
(2) neither party to the civil marriage resides in a jurisdiction that will maintain an action for dissolution
by the parties because of the sex or sexual orientation of the spouses.
(b) There is a rebuttable presumption that a jurisdiction will not maintain an action for dissolution if the
jurisdiction does not recognize the civil marriage.
(c) An action for dissolution authorized by this subdivision must be adjudicated in accordance with the
laws of this state.
History: (8586) RL s 3575; 1974 c 107 s 5; 1978 c 772 s 24; 1979 c 259 s 6; 2013 c 74 s 8
518.08 [Repealed, 1974 c 107 s 29]
518.09 PROCEEDING; HOW AND WHERE BROUGHT; VENUE.
A proceeding for dissolution or legal separation may be brought by either or both spouses and shall be
commenced by personal service of the summons and petition venued in the county where either spouse
resides. If neither party resides in the state and jurisdiction is based on the domicile of either spouse, the
proceeding may be brought in the county where either party is domiciled. If neither party resides or is
domiciled in this state and jurisdiction is premised upon one of the parties being a member of the armed
services stationed in this state for not less than 180 days immediately preceding the commencement of the
proceeding, the proceeding may be brought in the county where the member is stationed. This venue shall
be subject to the power of the court to change the place of hearing by consent of the parties, or when it
appears to the court that an impartial hearing cannot be had in the county where the proceedings are pending,
or when the convenience of the parties or the ends of justice would be promoted by the change. No summons
shall be required if a joint petition is filed.

518.11 SERVICE; ALTERNATE SERVICE; PUBLICATION.
(a) Unless a proceeding is brought by both parties, copies of the summons and petition shall be served
on the respondent personally.
(b) When service is made out of this state and within the United States, it may be proved by the affidavit
of the person making the same. When service is made without the United States it may be proved by the
affidavit of the person making the same, taken before and certified by any United States minister, charge
d'affaires, commissioner, consul or commercial agent, or other consular or diplomatic officer of the United
States appointed to reside in such country, including all deputies or other representatives of such officer
authorized to perform their duties; or before an officer authorized to administer an oath with the certificate
of an officer of a court of record of the country wherein such affidavit is taken as to the identity and authority
of the officer taking the same.
(c) If personal service cannot be made, the court may order service of the summons by alternate means.
The application for alternate service must include the last known location of the respondent; the petitioner's
most recent contacts with the respondent; the last known location of the respondent's employment; the names
and locations of the respondent's parents, siblings, children, and other close relatives; the names and locations

of other persons who are likely to know the respondent's whereabouts; and a description of efforts to locate
those persons.
The court shall consider the length of time the respondent's location has been unknown, the likelihood
that the respondent's location will become known, the nature of the relief sought, and the nature of efforts
made to locate the respondent. The court shall order service by first class mail, forwarding address requested,
to any addresses where there is a reasonable possibility that mail or information will be forwarded or
communicated to the respondent or, if no address so qualifies, then to the respondent's last known address.
If the petitioner seeks disposition of real estate located within the state of Minnesota, the court shall
order that the summons, which shall contain the legal description of the real estate, be published in the county
where the real estate is located. The court may also order publication, within or without the state, but only
if it might reasonably succeed in notifying the respondent of the proceeding. Also, the court may require
the petitioner to make efforts to locate the respondent by telephone calls to appropriate persons. Service
shall be deemed complete 21 days after mailing or 21 days after court-ordered publication.

518.12 TIME FOR ANSWERING.
The respondent shall have 30 days in which to answer the petition. In case of service by publication,
the 30 days shall not begin to run until the expiration of the period allowed for publication. In the case of a

shall be required to the counterpetition and the original petitioner shall be deemed to have denied each and
every statement, allegation and claim in the counterpetition.

518.13 FAILURE TO ANSWER; FINDINGS; HEARING.
Subdivision 1. Default. If the respondent does not appear after service duly made and proved, the court
may hear and determine the proceeding as a default matter.
Subd. 2. Dispute over irretrievable breakdown. If one of the parties has denied under oath or affirmation
that the marriage is irretrievably broken, the court shall consider all relevant factors, including the
circumstances that gave rise to the commencement of the proceeding and the prospect of reconciliation, and
shall make a finding whether the marriage is irretrievably broken.
A finding of irretrievable breakdown under this subdivision is a determination that there is no reasonable
prospect of reconciliation. The finding must be supported by evidence that (i) the parties have lived separate
and apart for a period of not less than 180 days immediately preceding the commencement of the proceeding,
or (ii) there is serious marital discord adversely affecting the attitude of one or both of the parties toward
the marriage.
Subd. 3. Agreement over irretrievable breakdown. If both parties by petition or otherwise have stated
under oath or affirmation that the marriage is irretrievably broken, or one of the parties has so stated and
the other has not denied it, the court, after hearing, shall make a finding that the marriage is irretrievably
broken.

Subd. 4. Referee; open court. The court or judge, upon application, may refer the proceeding to a
referee to take and report the evidence therein. Hearings for dissolution of marriage shall be heard in open
court or before a referee appointed by the court to receive the testimony of the witnesses, or depositions
taken as in other equitable actions. However, the court may in its discretion close the hearing.
Subd. 5. Approval without hearing. Proposed findings of fact, conclusions of law, order for judgment,
and judgment and decree must be submitted to the court for approval and filing without a final hearing in
the following situations:
(1) if there are no minor children of the marriage, and (i) the parties have entered into a written stipulation,
or (ii) the respondent has not appeared after service duly made and proved by affidavit and at least 20 days
have elapsed since the time for answering under section 518.12 expired; or
(2) if there are minor children of the marriage, the parties have signed and acknowledged a stipulation,
and all parties are represented by counsel.
Notwithstanding clause (1) or (2), the court shall schedule the matter for hearing in any case where the
proposed judgment and decree does not appear to be in the best interests of the minor children or is contrary
to the interests of justice.

518.131 TEMPORARY ORDERS AND RESTRAINING ORDERS.
Subdivision 1. Permissible orders. In a proceeding brought for custody, dissolution, or legal separation,
or for disposition of property, maintenance, or child support following the dissolution of a marriage, either
party may, by motion, request from the court and the court may grant a temporary order pending the final
disposition of the proceeding to or for:
(a) Temporary custody and parenting time regarding the minor children of the parties. In addition to the
requirements under section 518.17, subdivision 1, the court must consider the child's parenting time with
each parent before the pending action commenced. If the child's access to a parent was limited or restricted
before the action commenced, the court must determine the child's custody and parenting time in a manner
that supports the child's opportunity to develop a relationship with both parents in accordance with sections
518.17 and 518.175;
(b) Temporary maintenance of either spouse;
(c) Temporary child support for the children of the parties;
(d) Temporary costs and reasonable attorney fees;
(e) Award the temporary use and possession, exclusive or otherwise, of the family home, furniture,
household goods, automobiles, and other property of the parties;
(f) Restrain one or both parties from transferring, encumbering, concealing, or disposing of property
except in the usual course of business or for the necessities of life, and to account to the court for all such
transfers, encumbrances, dispositions, and expenditures made after the order is served or communicated to
the party restrained in open court;
(g) Restrain one or both parties from harassing, vilifying, mistreating, molesting, disturbing the peace,
or restraining the liberty of the other party or the children of the parties;
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.131
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
12
(h) Restrain one or both parties from removing any minor child of the parties from the jurisdiction of
the court;
(i) Exclude a party from the family home of the parties or from the home of the other party; and
(j) Require one or both of the parties to perform or to not perform such additional acts as will facilitate
the just and speedy disposition of the proceeding, or will protect the parties or their children from physical
or emotional harm.
Subd. 2. Impermissible orders. No temporary order shall:
(a) Deny parenting time to a parent unless the court finds that the parenting time is likely to cause
physical or emotional harm to the child;
(b) Exclude a party from the family home of the parties unless the court finds that physical or emotional
harm to one of the parties or to the children of the parties is likely to result, or that the exclusion is reasonable
in the circumstances; or
(c) Vacate or modify an order granted under section 518B.01, subdivision 6, paragraph (a), clause (1),
restraining an abusing party from committing acts of domestic abuse, except that the court may hear a motion
for modification of an order for protection concurrently with a proceeding for dissolution of marriage upon
notice of motion and motion. The notice required by court rule shall not be waived. If the proceedings are
consolidated and the motion to modify is granted, a separate order for modification of an order for protection
shall be issued.
Subd. 3. Ex parte restraining order; limitations. A party may request and the court may make an ex
parte restraining order which may include any matter that may be included in a temporary order except:
(a) A restraining order may not exclude either party from the family home of the parties except upon a
finding by the court of immediate danger of physical harm to the other party or the children of either party;
and
(b) A restraining order may not deny parenting time to either party or grant custody of the minor children
to either party except upon a finding by the court of immediate danger of physical harm to the minor children
of the parties.
Subd. 4. Hearing on restraining order; duration. Restraining orders shall be personally served upon
the party to be restrained and shall be accompanied with a notice of the time and place of hearing for
disposition of the matters contained in the restraining order at a hearing for a temporary order. When a
restraining order has been issued, a hearing on the temporary order shall be held at the earliest practicable
date. The restrained party may upon written notice to the other party advance the hearing date to a time
earlier than that noticed by the other party. The restraining order shall continue in full force and effect only
until the hearing time noticed, unless the court, for good cause and upon notice extends the time for hearing.
Subd. 5. Duration of temporary order. A temporary order shall continue in full force and effect until
the earlier of its amendment or vacation, dismissal of the main action or entry of a final decree of dissolution
or legal separation.
Subd. 6. Effect of dismissal of main action. If a proceeding for dissolution or legal separation is
dismissed, a temporary custody order is vacated unless one of the parties or the child's custodian moves that
the proceeding continue as a custody proceeding and the court finds, after a hearing, that the circumstances
of the parties and the best interests of the child require that a custody order be issued.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes13
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.14
Subd. 7. Guiding factors. The court shall be guided by the factors set forth in chapter 518A (concerning
child support), and sections 518.552 (concerning maintenance), 518.17 to 518.175 (concerning custody and
parenting time), and 518.14 (concerning costs and attorney fees) in making temporary orders and restraining
orders.
Subd. 8. Basis for order. Temporary orders shall be made solely on the basis of affidavits and argument
of counsel except upon demand by either party in a motion or responsive motion made within the time limit
for making and filing a responsive motion that the matter be heard on oral testimony before the court, or if
the court in its discretion orders the taking of oral testimony.
Subd. 9. Prejudicial effect; revocation; modification. A temporary order or restraining order:
(a) Shall not prejudice the rights of the parties or the child which are to be adjudicated at subsequent
hearings in the proceeding; and
(b) May be revoked or modified by the court before the final disposition of the proceeding upon the
same grounds and subject to the same requirements as the initial granting of the order.
Subd. 10. Misdemeanor. In addition to being punishable by contempt, a violation of a provision of a
temporary order or restraining order granting the relief authorized in subdivision 1, clause (g), (h), or (i), is
a misdemeanor.
Subd. 11. Cases given priority for temporary relief. (a) While the proceeding is pending, the court
must give priority to scheduling and holding an expedited hearing for temporary relief when a party credibly
alleges that:
(1) the party has been denied parenting time with a child for 14 consecutive days or more; or
(2) the party has been unreasonably denied access to necessary financial resources or support during a
pending marital dissolution.
(b) A court must hold a priority hearing under this subdivision within 30 days of the party's request.
(c) A court must consider credible allegations of domestic abuse, substance abuse, maltreatment findings,
or neglect as a reasonable basis for a party who has denied parenting time to the other party.
(d) If temporary parenting time is ordered, the court may also order temporary child support if requested
by the other party.

518.135 [Repealed, 1979 c 259 s 35]
518.14 COSTS AND DISBURSEMENTS; ATTORNEY FEES; COLLECTION COSTS.
Subdivision 1. General. Except as provided in section 518A.735, in a proceeding under this chapter or
chapter 518A, the court shall award attorney fees, costs, and disbursements in an amount necessary to enable
a party to carry on or contest the proceeding, provided it finds:
(1) that the fees are necessary for the good faith assertion of the party's rights in the proceeding and will
not contribute unnecessarily to the length and expense of the proceeding;
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.14
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
14
(2) that the party from whom fees, costs, and disbursements are sought has the means to pay them; and
(3) that the party to whom fees, costs, and disbursements are awarded does not have the means to pay
them.
Subd. 1a. Other award. The court may award, in its discretion, additional fees, costs, and disbursements
against a party who unreasonably contributes to the length or expense of the proceeding or whose unreasonable
failure to comply with an order or decree causes the other party to seek enforcement or other relief, including
the reimbursement of fees and costs incurred before filing a motion. In determining whether to award fees,
the court must consider the circumstances and any other factors that contributed to the length or expense of
the proceeding. Fees, costs, and disbursements provided for in this section and section 518A.735 may be
awarded at any point in the proceeding, including a modification proceeding under sections 518.18 and
518A.39. The court may adjudge costs and disbursements against either party. The court may authorize the
collection of money awarded by execution, or out of property sequestered, or in any other manner within
the power of the court. An award of attorney's fees made by the court during the pendency of the proceeding
or in the final judgment survives the proceeding and if not paid by the party directed to pay the same may
be enforced as above provided or by a separate civil action brought in the attorney's own name. If the
proceeding is dismissed or abandoned prior to determination and award of attorney's fees, the court may
nevertheless award attorney's fees upon the attorney's motion. The award shall also survive the proceeding
and may be enforced in the same manner as last above provided.

2024 c 101 art 1 s 5
518.145 DECREE, FINALITY AND REOPENING.
Subdivision 1. Appeal. A decree of dissolution of marriage or of legal separation is final when entered,
subject to the right of appeal. When entered, the findings of fact and conclusions of law may constitute the
judgment and decree. An appeal from the decree of dissolution that does not challenge the finding that the
marriage is irretrievably broken does not delay the finality of that provision of the decree which dissolves
the marriage beyond the time for appealing from that provision. A party may remarry before the time for
appeal has run if it is not contested that the marriage is irretrievably broken or if a stipulation that the marriage
is irretrievably broken is incorporated in the decree of dissolution.
Subd. 2. Reopening. On motion and upon terms as are just, the court may relieve a party from a judgment
and decree, order, or proceeding under this chapter, except for provisions dissolving the bonds of marriage,
annulling the marriage, or directing that the parties are legally separated, and may order a new trial or grant
other relief as may be just for the following reasons:
(1) mistake, inadvertence, surprise, or excusable neglect;
(2) newly discovered evidence which by due diligence could not have been discovered in time to move
for a new trial under the Rules of Civil Procedure, rule 59.03;
(3) fraud, whether denominated intrinsic or extrinsic, misrepresentation, or other misconduct of an
adverse party;
(4) the judgment and decree or order is void; or
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes15
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.15
(5) the judgment has been satisfied, released, or discharged, or a prior judgment and decree or order
upon which it is based has been reversed or otherwise vacated, or it is no longer equitable that the judgment
and decree or order should have prospective application.
The motion must be made within a reasonable time, and for a reason under clause (1), (2), or (3), not
more than one year after the judgment and decree, order, or proceeding was entered or taken. A motion
under this subdivision does not affect the finality of a judgment and decree or order or suspend its operation.
This subdivision does not limit the power of a court to entertain an independent action to relieve a party
from a judgment and decree, order, or proceeding or to grant relief to a party not actually personally notified
as provided in the Rules of Civil Procedure, or to set aside a judgment for fraud upon the court.

The Social Security numbers and tax returns required under this chapter and chapter 518A are not
accessible to the public, except that they must be disclosed to the other parties to a proceeding as provided
in section 518A.28.

518.148 CERTIFICATION OF DISSOLUTION.
Subdivision 1. Certificate of dissolution. (a) The court must prepare a separate certificate of dissolution
to be attached to the judgment and decree at the time of granting the dissolution of marriage. Upon approval
by the court and filing of the certificate of dissolution with the court administrator, the court administrator
shall provide to any party upon request certified copies of the certificate of dissolution. The court may direct
an attorney or pro se party to prepare and submit the certificate of dissolution to the court.
(b) If a certificate of dissolution has not been prepared, either party may make a written request for a
certificate of dissolution and the court shall approve a request pursuant to this section. The court may require
the requesting party or their attorney to prepare the certificate of dissolution and submit the certificate to
the court.
Subd. 2. Required information. The certificate shall include the following information:
(1) the full caption and file number of the case and the title "Certificate of Dissolution";
(2) the names and any prior or other names of the parties to the dissolution;
(3) that the marriage of the parties is dissolved;
(4) the date of the judgment and decree; and
(5) if a name change has been granted, the former and the new name of the party whose name was
changed through the dissolution.
Subd. 3. Certification. The certificate of dissolution shall be conclusive evidence of the facts recited
in the certificate.

518.155 CUSTODY DETERMINATIONS.
Notwithstanding any law to the contrary, a court in which a proceeding for dissolution, legal separation,
or child custody has been commenced shall not issue, revise, modify or amend any order, pursuant to sections
518.131, 518.165, 518.168, 518.17, 518.175 or 518.18, which affects the custody of a minor child or the
parenting time of a parent unless the court has jurisdiction over the matter pursuant to the provisions of

child has been entered.
Subd. 2. Required notice. Written notice of a child custody or parenting time or visitation proceeding

responsive pleading. The court may, upon a showing of good cause, permit the intervention of other interested
parties.
Subd. 3. Summons; joint petition. No summons shall be required if a joint petition is filed and no
summons is needed where a decree of dissolution or legal separation has been entered or paternity has been
adjudicated under section 257.66.
Subd. 4. Social Security numbers; financial documents. (a) In a proceeding where child support will
be addressed, the petition, joint petition, or motion under subdivision 1 must be accompanied by a separate
document that contains the Social Security number of each party and child. The Social Security number
document must be maintained in a portion of the court file or records that are not accessible to the general
public.
(b) In a proceeding where child support will be addressed, the petition, joint petition, or motion under
subdivision 1 must be accompanied by separate documentation providing evidence of income for each party
in accordance with section 518A.28. The income information shall be maintained in a portion of the court
file or records that are not accessible to the general public.

issues regarding custody, parenting time, and child support, the parties may proceed using a joint petition,
agreement, and proposed order. A copy of the properly executed recognition of parentage form that was

court in this state or elsewhere or whether a separate order for custody, parenting time, or child support
exists and, if section 518A.44 applies, the public authority is in agreement with the child support petition;
(6) any temporary or permanent child support, child custody, parenting time, attorney fees, costs, and
disbursements applied for without setting forth the amounts;

The joint petition shall be verified by each party, and the petition's allegations established by competent

including the reasons for any deviation from the child support guidelines, and be signed by each petitioner
and the public authority if section 518A.44 applies. The agreement must include a waiver to the statutory
right to counsel on the issue of parentage if it applies and, if either of the parties is not represented by counsel,

resolution options. The chief judge of each judicial district or a designee may require that children attend a
separate education program designed to deal with the impact of divorce upon children as part of the parent
education program. Each parent education program must enable persons to have timely and reasonable
access to education sessions.
(b) The chief judge of each judicial district shall ensure that the judicial district's website includes
information on the parent education program or programs required under this section.
Subd. 2. Minimum standards; plan. The Minnesota Supreme Court should promulgate minimum
standards for the implementation and administration of a parent education program.
Subd. 3. Attendance. (a) In a proceeding under this chapter where the parties have not agreed to custody
or a parenting time schedule, the court shall order the parents of a minor child to attend or take online a
minimum of eight hours in an orientation and education program that meets the minimum standards
promulgated by the Minnesota Supreme Court.
(b) In all other proceedings involving custody, support, or parenting time the court may order the parents
of a minor child to attend a parent education program.
(c) The program shall provide the court with names of persons who fail to attend the parent education
program as ordered by the court. Persons who are separated or contemplating involvement in a dissolution,
paternity, custody, or parenting time proceeding may attend a parent education program without a court
order.

(d) Unless otherwise ordered by the court, participation in a parent education program must begin before
an initial case management conference and within 30 days after the first filing with the court or as soon as
practicable after that time based on the reasonable availability of classes for the program for the parent.
Parent education programs must offer an opportunity to participate at all phases of a pending or postdecree
proceeding.
(e) Upon request of a party and a showing of good cause, the court may excuse the party from attending
the program. If past or present domestic abuse, as defined in chapter 518B, is alleged, the court shall not
require the parties to attend the same parent education sessions and shall enter an order setting forth the
manner in which the parties may safely participate in the program.
(f) Before an initial case management conference for a proceeding under this chapter where the parties
have not agreed to custody or parenting time, the court shall notify the parties of their option to resolve
disagreements, including the development of a parenting plan, through the use of private mediation.
Subd. 4. Sanctions. The court may impose sanctions upon a parent for failure to attend or complete a
parent education program as ordered.
Subd. 5. Confidentiality. Unless all parties agree in writing, statements made by a party during
participation in a parent education program are inadmissible as evidence for any purpose, including
impeachment. No record may be made regarding a party's participation in a parent education program, except
a record of attendance at and completion of the program as required under this section. Instructors shall not
disclose information regarding an individual participant obtained as a result of participation in a parent
education program. Parent education instructors may not be subpoenaed or called as witnesses in court
proceedings.
Subd. 6. Fee. Except as provided in this subdivision, each person who attends a parent education program
shall pay a fee to defray the cost of the program. A party who qualifies for waiver of filing fees under section
563.01 is exempt from paying the parent education program fee and the court shall waive the fee or direct
its payment under section 563.01. Program providers shall implement a sliding fee scale.

518.165 GUARDIANS AD LITEM FOR MINOR CHILDREN.
Subdivision 1. Permissive appointment of guardian ad litem. In all proceedings for child custody or
for dissolution or legal separation where custody or parenting time with a minor child is in issue, the court
may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interests of the child. The guardian ad litem shall advise
the court with respect to custody and parenting time.
Subd. 2. Required appointment of guardian ad litem. In all proceedings for child custody or for
marriage dissolution or legal separation in which custody or parenting time with a minor child is an issue,
if the court has reason to believe that the minor child is a victim of domestic child abuse or neglect, as those
terms are defined in section 260C.007 and chapter 260E, respectively, the court shall appoint a guardian ad
litem. The guardian ad litem shall represent the interests of the child and advise the court with respect to
custody and parenting time. If the child is represented by a guardian ad litem in any other pending proceeding,
the court may appoint that guardian to represent the child in the custody or parenting time proceeding. No
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.165
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024

guardian ad litem need be appointed if the alleged domestic child abuse or neglect is before the court on a
juvenile dependency and neglect petition. Nothing in this subdivision requires the court to appoint a guardian
ad litem in any proceeding for child custody, marriage dissolution, or legal separation in which an allegation
of domestic child abuse or neglect has not been made.
Subd. 2a. Responsibilities of guardian ad litem. A guardian ad litem shall carry out the following
responsibilities:
(1) conduct an independent investigation to determine the facts relevant to the situation of the child and
the family, which must include, unless specifically excluded by the court, reviewing relevant documents;
meeting with and observing the child in the home setting and considering the child's wishes, as appropriate;
and interviewing parents, caregivers, and others with knowledge relevant to the case;
(2) advocate for the child's best interests by participating in appropriate aspects of the case and advocating
for appropriate community services when necessary;
(3) maintain the confidentiality of information related to a case, with the exception of sharing information
as permitted by law to promote cooperative solutions that are in the best interests of the child;
(4) monitor the child's best interests throughout the judicial proceeding; and
(5) present written reports on the child's best interests that include conclusions and recommendations
and the facts upon which they are based.
Subd. 3. Fees. (a) If a guardian ad litem is appointed on a fee basis, the court shall enter an order for
costs, fees, and disbursements in favor of the child's guardian ad litem. The order may be made against either
or both parties, except that any part of the costs, fees, or disbursements which the court finds the parties are
incapable of paying shall be borne by the State Guardian Ad Litem Board. In no event may the court order
that costs, fees, or disbursements be paid by a party receiving public assistance or legal assistance or by a
party whose annual income falls below the poverty line as established under United States Code, title 42,
section 9902(2).
(b) In each fiscal year, the commissioner of management and budget shall deposit guardian ad litem
reimbursements in the special revenue fund and credit them to a separate account with the State Guardian
Ad Litem Board. The balance of this account is appropriated to the State Guardian Ad Litem Board and
does not cancel but is available until expended. Revenue from this account must be spent in the judicial
district in which the reimbursement is collected.
Subd. 4. Background study of guardian ad litem. (a) The court shall initiate a background study
through the commissioner of human services under section 245C.32 on every guardian ad litem appointed
under this section if a background study has not been completed on the guardian ad litem within the past
three years. The background study must be completed before the court appoints the guardian ad litem, unless
the court determines that it is in the best interest of the child to appoint a guardian ad litem before a background
study can be completed by the commissioner. The court shall initiate a subsequent background study under
this paragraph once every three years after the guardian has been appointed as long as the individual continues
to serve as a guardian ad litem.
(b) The background study must include criminal history data from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension,
other criminal history data held by the commissioner of human services, and data regarding whether the
person has been a perpetrator of substantiated maltreatment of a minor or a vulnerable adult. When the
information from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension indicates that the subject of a study under paragraph
(a) is a multistate offender or that the subject's multistate offender status is undetermined, the court shall
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes21
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.165
require a search of the National Criminal Records Repository, and shall provide the commissioner a set of
classifiable fingerprints of the subject of the study.
(c) The Minnesota Supreme Court shall pay the commissioner a fee for conducting a background study
under section 245C.32.
(d) Nothing precludes the court from initiating background studies using court data on criminal
convictions.
Subd. 5. Procedure, criminal history, and maltreatment records background study. (a) When the
court requests a background study under subdivision 4, paragraph (a), the request shall be submitted to the
Department of Human Services through the department's electronic online background study system.
(b) When the court requests a search of the National Criminal Records Repository, the court must provide
a set of classifiable fingerprints of the subject of the study on a fingerprint card provided by the commissioner
of human services.
(c) The commissioner of human services shall provide the court with criminal history data as defined
in section 13.87 from the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension in the Department of Public Safety, other criminal
history data held by the commissioner of human services, and data regarding substantiated maltreatment of
a minor under chapter 260E, and substantiated maltreatment of a vulnerable adult under section 626.557,
within 15 working days of receipt of a request. If the subject of the study has been determined by the
Department of Human Services or the Department of Health to be the perpetrator of substantiated maltreatment
of a minor or vulnerable adult in a licensed facility, the response must include a copy of the public portion
of the investigation memorandum under section 260E.30 or the public portion of the investigation
memorandum under section 626.557, subdivision 12b. When the background study shows that the subject
has been determined by a county adult protection or child protection agency to have been responsible for
maltreatment, the court shall be informed of the county, the date of the finding, and the nature of the
maltreatment that was substantiated. The commissioner shall provide the court with information from the
National Criminal Records Repository within three working days of the commissioner's receipt of the data.
When the commissioner finds no criminal history or substantiated maltreatment on a background study
subject, the commissioner shall make these results available to the court electronically through the secure
online background study system.
(d) Notwithstanding section 260E.30 or 626.557, subdivision 12b, if the commissioner or county lead
agency or lead investigative agency has information that a person on whom a background study was previously
done under this section has been determined to be a perpetrator of maltreatment of a minor or vulnerable
adult, the commissioner or the county may provide this information to the court that requested the background
study.
Subd. 6. Rights. The court shall notify the subject of a background study that the subject has the following
rights:
(1) the right to be informed that the court will request a background study on the subject for the purpose
of determining whether the person's appointment or continued appointment is in the best interests of the
child;
(2) the right to be informed of the results of the study and to obtain from the court a copy of the results;
and

(3) the right to challenge the accuracy and completeness of the information contained in the results to
the agency responsible for creation of the data except to the extent precluded by section 256.045, subdivision

518.166 INTERVIEWS.
The court may interview the child in chambers to ascertain the child's reasonable preference as to
custodian, if the court deems the child to be of sufficient age to express preference. The court shall permit
counsel to be present at the interview and shall permit counsel to propound reasonable questions to the child
either directly or through the court. The court shall cause a record of the interview to be made and to be
made part of the record in the case unless waived by the parties.
In contested custody proceedings, and in other custody proceedings if a parent or the child's custodian
requests, the court may seek the recommendations of professional personnel whether or not they are employed
on a regular basis by the court. The recommendations given shall be in writing and shall be made available
by the court to counsel upon request. Counsel may call for cross-examination of professional personnel
consulted by the court.

518.167 INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTS.
Subdivision 1. Court order. In contested custody proceedings, and in other custody proceedings if a
parent or the child's custodian requests, the court may order an investigation and report concerning custodial
arrangements for the child. If the county elects to conduct an investigation, the county may charge a fee.
The investigation and report may be made by the county welfare agency or department of court services.
Subd. 2. Preparation. (a) In preparing a report concerning a child, the investigator may consult any
person who may have information about the child and the potential custodial arrangements except for persons
involved in mediation efforts between the parties. Mediation personnel may disclose to investigators and
evaluators information collected during mediation only if agreed to in writing by all parties. Upon order of
the court, the investigator may refer the child to professional personnel for diagnosis. The investigator may
consult with and obtain information from medical, psychiatric, school personnel, or other expert persons
who have served the child in the past after obtaining the consent of the parents or the child's custodian or
guardian.
(b) The report submitted by the investigator must:
(1) state the position of each party;
(2) consider and evaluate the factors in section 518.17, subdivision 1;
(3) include a detailed analysis of all information considered for each factor;
(4) state the investigator's recommendation and the reason for the recommendation; and
(5) reference established means for dispute resolution between the parties.

Subd. 3. Availability to counsel. The court shall mail the investigator's report to counsel and to any
party not represented by counsel at least ten days before the hearing. The investigator shall maintain and,
upon request, make available to counsel and to a party not represented by counsel the investigator's file of
underlying data and reports, complete texts of diagnostic reports made to the investigator pursuant to the
provisions of subdivision 2, and the names and addresses of all persons whom the investigator has consulted.
The investigator and any person the investigator has consulted is subject to other pretrial discovery in
accordance with the requirements of the Minnesota Rules of Civil Procedure. Mediation proceedings are
not subject to discovery without written consent of both parties. A party to the proceeding may call the
investigator and any person whom the investigator has consulted for cross-examination at the hearing. A
party may not waive the right of cross-examination before the hearing.
Subd. 4. Use at hearing. The investigator's report may be received in evidence at the hearing.
Subd. 5. Costs. The court shall order all or part of the cost of the investigation and report to be paid by
either or both parties, based on their ability to pay. Any part of the cost that the court finds the parties are
incapable of paying must be borne by the county welfare agency or department of court services that performs
the investigation. The court may not order costs under this subdivision to be paid by a party receiving public
assistance or legal assistance from a qualified legal services program or by a party whose annual income
falls below the poverty line under United States Code, title 42, section 9902(2).

518.168 HEARINGS.
(a) Custody proceedings shall receive priority in being set for hearing.
(b) The court may tax as costs the payment of necessary travel and other expenses incurred by a person
whose presence at the hearing the court deems necessary to determine the best interests of the child.
(c) The court without a jury shall determine questions of law and fact. If it finds that a public hearing
may be detrimental to the child's best interests, the court may exclude the public from a custody hearing,
but may admit any person who has a direct interest in the particular case.
(d) If the court finds it necessary for the protection of the child's welfare that the record of an interview,
report, investigation, or testimony in a custody proceeding be kept secret, the court may make an appropriate
order sealing the record.
(e) At the first hearing or at an initial appearance before the court under this chapter, the court shall
provide an information sheet to the parties explaining:
(1) in cases where alternative dispute resolution is required under General Rules of Practice, rule 310.01,

518.17 CUSTODY AND SUPPORT OF CHILDREN ON JUDGMENT.
Subdivision 1. Best interests of the child. (a) In evaluating the best interests of the child for purposes
of determining issues of custody and parenting time, the court must consider and evaluate all relevant factors,
including:
(1) a child's physical, emotional, cultural, spiritual, and other needs, and the effect of the proposed
arrangements on the child's needs and development;
(2) any special medical, mental health, developmental disability, or educational needs that the child may
have that may require special parenting arrangements or access to recommended services;
(3) the reasonable preference of the child, if the court deems the child to be of sufficient ability, age,
and maturity to express an independent, reliable preference;
(4) whether domestic abuse, as defined in section 518B.01, has occurred in the parents' or either parent's
household or relationship; the nature and context of the domestic abuse; and the implications of the domestic
abuse for parenting and for the child's safety, well-being, and developmental needs;
(5) any physical, mental, or chemical health issue of a parent that affects the child's safety or
developmental needs;
(6) the history and nature of each parent's participation in providing care for the child;
(7) the willingness and ability of each parent to provide ongoing care for the child; to meet the child's
ongoing developmental, emotional, spiritual, and cultural needs; and to maintain consistency and follow
through with parenting time;
(8) the effect on the child's well-being and development of changes to home, school, and community;
(9) the effect of the proposed arrangements on the ongoing relationships between the child and each
parent, siblings, and other significant persons in the child's life;
(10) the benefit to the child in maximizing parenting time with both parents and the detriment to the
child in limiting parenting time with either parent;
(11) except in cases in which domestic abuse as described in clause (4) has occurred, the disposition of
each parent to support the child's relationship with the other parent and to encourage and permit frequent
and continuing contact between the child and the other parent; and
(12) the willingness and ability of parents to cooperate in the rearing of their child; to maximize sharing
information and minimize exposure of the child to parental conflict; and to utilize methods for resolving
disputes regarding any major decision concerning the life of the child.
(b) Clauses (1) to (9) govern the application of the best interests of the child factors by the court:
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes25
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.17
(1) The court must make detailed findings on each of the factors in paragraph (a) based on the evidence
presented and explain how each factor led to its conclusions and to the determination of custody and parenting
time. The court may not use one factor to the exclusion of all others, and the court shall consider that the
factors may be interrelated.
(2) The court shall consider that it is in the best interests of the child to promote the child's healthy
growth and development through safe, stable, nurturing relationships between a child and both parents. In
determining custody, the court must consider the best interests of the child and must not prefer one parent
over the other solely on the basis of the gender of the parent.
(3) The court shall consider both parents as having the capacity to develop and sustain nurturing
relationships with their children unless there are substantial reasons to believe otherwise. In assessing whether
parents are capable of sustaining nurturing relationships with their children, the court shall recognize that
there are many ways that parents can respond to a child's needs with sensitivity and provide the child love
and guidance, and these may differ between parents and among cultures.
(4) The court shall not consider conduct of a party that does not affect the party's relationship with the
child.
(5) Disability alone, as defined in section 363A.03, of a proposed custodian or the child shall not be
determinative of the custody of the child.
(6) The court shall consider evidence of a violation of section 609.507 in determining the best interests
of the child.
(7) There is no presumption for or against joint physical custody, except as provided in clause (9).
(8) Joint physical custody does not require an absolutely equal division of time.
(9) The court shall use a rebuttable presumption that upon request of either or both parties, joint legal
custody is in the best interests of the child. However, the court shall use a rebuttable presumption that joint
legal custody or joint physical custody is not in the best interests of the child if domestic abuse, as defined
in section 518B.01, has occurred between the parents. In determining whether the presumption is rebutted,
the court shall consider the nature and context of the domestic abuse and the implications of the domestic
abuse for parenting and for the child's safety, well-being, and developmental needs. Disagreement alone
over whether to grant sole or joint custody does not constitute an inability of parents to cooperate in the
rearing of their children as referenced in paragraph (a), clause (12).
(c) In a proceeding involving the custodial responsibility of a service member's child, a court may not
consider only a parent's past deployment or possible future deployment in determining the best interests of
the child. For purposes of this paragraph, "custodial responsibility" has the meaning given in section 518E.102,
paragraph (f).

Subd. 2. [Repealed, 2015 c 30 art 1 s 13]
Subd. 2a. Parents with disabilities. (a) A court shall not deny nor restrict a parent's parenting time or
custody due to the parent's disability. A party raising disability as a basis for denying or restricting parenting
time has the burden to prove by clear and convincing evidence that a parent's specific behaviors during
parenting time would endanger the health or safety of the child. If the party meets the burden, a parent with
a disability shall have the opportunity to demonstrate how implementing supportive services can alleviate
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.17
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
26
any concerns. The court may require a parent with a disability to use supportive parenting services to facilitate
parenting time.
(b) If a court denies or limits the right of a parent with a disability to custody of a child or visitation with
a child, the court shall make specific written findings stating the basis for the denial or limitation and why
providing supportive parenting services is not a reasonable accommodation that could prevent denying or
limiting the parent's custody or parenting time.
(c) For purposes of this subdivision, "disability" and "supportive parenting services" have the meanings
given in section 260C.141, subdivision 1a.
Subd. 3. Custody order. (a) Upon adjudging the nullity of a marriage, or in a dissolution or separation
proceeding, or in a child custody proceeding, the court shall make such further order as it deems just and
proper concerning:
(1) the legal custody of the minor children of the parties that shall be sole or joint;
(2) their physical custody, parenting time, and residence; and
(3) their support.
(b) The court shall grant the rights listed in subdivision 3a to each of the parties, regardless of custodial
designation, unless specific findings are made under section 518.68, subdivision 1. The court shall include
in the custody order the notice under subdivision 3a.
(c) The court may waive any of the rights under this section if it finds it is necessary to protect the
welfare of a party or child.
(d) If a court order or law prohibits contact by a party, the notifications and information required to be
sent under subdivision 3a, clauses (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6), shall not be made by direct communication of
the parties. Third-party communication shall be limited to the specific purposes delineated in this subdivision
or subdivision 3a. Nothing in this subdivision or subdivision 3a shall modify, suspend, revoke, or terminate
a court order or law that prohibits contact by a party.
(e) If one of the parties is a program participant under chapter 5B, the other party shall send all information
and notifications required under subdivision 3a, clauses (1), (2), (3), (5), and (6), to the participant's designated
address. The program participant is exempted from the requirements of subdivision 3a.
(f) Failure to notify or inform a party of rights under subdivision 3a does not form a basis for modification
under section 518.18, paragraph (d), clause (iv), unless other grounds are alleged which would support a
modification.
Subd. 3a. Contents on notice. The required notice under subdivision 3 must be substantially as follows:
"NOTICE
EACH PARTY IS GRANTED THE FOLLOWING RIGHTS:
(1) right of access to, and to receive copies of, school, medical, dental, religious training, police reports,

Subdivision 1. Definition. "Domestic abuse" for the purposes of this section has the meaning given in
section 518B.01, subdivision 2.
Subd. 2. Plan elements. (a) A parenting plan must include the following:
(1) a schedule of the time each parent spends with the child;
(2) a designation of decision-making responsibilities regarding the child; and
(3) a method of dispute resolution.
(b) A parenting plan may include other issues and matters the parents agree to regarding the child.
(c) Parents voluntarily agreeing to parenting plans may substitute other terms for physical and legal
custody, including designations of joint or sole custody, provided that the terms used in the substitution are
defined in the parenting plan.
Subd. 3. Creating parenting plan; restrictions on creation; alternative. (a) Upon the request of both
parents, a parenting plan must be created in lieu of an order for child custody and parenting time unless the
court makes detailed findings that the proposed plan is not in the best interests of the child.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.1705
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
28
(b) If both parents do not agree to a parenting plan, the court may create one on its own motion, except
that the court must not do so if it finds that a parent has committed domestic abuse against a parent or child
who is a party to, or subject of, the matter before the court. If the court creates a parenting plan on its own
motion, it must not use alternative terminology unless the terminology is agreed to by the parties.
(c) If an existing order does not contain a parenting plan, the parents must not be required to create a
parenting plan as part of a modification order under section 518A.39.
(d) A parenting plan must not be required during an action under section 518A.82.
(e) If the parents do not agree to a parenting plan and the court does not create one on its own motion,
orders for custody and parenting time must be entered under sections 518.17 and 518.175 or section 257.541,
as applicable.
Subd. 4. Custody designation. A final judgment and decree that includes a parenting plan using alternate
terms to designate decision-making responsibilities or allocation of residential time between the parents
must designate whether the parents have joint legal custody or joint physical custody or which parent has
sole legal custody or sole physical custody, or both. This designation is solely for enforcement of the final
judgment and decree where this designation is required for that enforcement and has no effect under the
laws of this state, any other state, or another country that do not require this designation.
Subd. 5. Role of court. If both parents agree to the use of a parenting plan but are unable to agree on
all terms, the court may create a parenting plan under this section. If the court is considering a parenting
plan, it may require each parent to submit a proposed parenting plan at any time before entry of the final
judgment and decree. If parents seek the court's assistance in deciding the schedule for each parent's time
with the child or designation of decision-making responsibilities regarding the child, the court may order
an evaluation and should consider the appointment of a guardian ad litem. Parenting plans, whether entered
on the court's own motion, following a contested hearing, or reviewed by the court pursuant to a stipulation,
must be based on the best interests factors in section 518.17 or 257.025, as applicable.
Subd. 6. Restrictions on preparation of parenting plan. (a) Dispute resolution processes other than
the judicial process may not be required in the preparation of a parenting plan if a parent is alleged to have
committed domestic abuse toward a parent or child who is a party to, or subject of, the matter before the
court. In these cases, the court shall consider the appointment of a guardian ad litem and a parenting plan
evaluator.
(b) The court may not require a parenting plan that provides for joint legal custody or use of dispute
resolution processes, other than the judicial process, if the court finds that section 518.179 applies or the
court finds that either parent has engaged in the following toward a parent or child who is a party to, or
subject of, the matter before the court:
(1) acts of domestic abuse, including physical harm, bodily injury, and infliction of fear of physical
harm, assault, terroristic threats, or criminal sexual conduct;
(2) physical, sexual, or a pattern of emotional abuse of a child; or
(3) willful abandonment that continues for an extended period of time or substantial refusal to perform
parenting functions.
Subd. 7. Moving the child to another state. Parents may agree upon the legal standard that will govern
a decision concerning removal of a child's residence from this state, provided that:
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes29
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.175
(1) both parents were represented by counsel when the parenting plan was approved; or
(2) the court found the parents were fully informed, the agreement was voluntary, and the parents were
aware of its implications.
Subd. 8. Allocation of certain expenses. (a) Parents creating a parenting plan are subject to the
requirements of the child support guidelines under chapter 518A.
(b) Parents may include in the parenting plan an allocation of expenses for the child. The allocation is
an enforceable contract between the parents.
Subd. 9. Modification of parenting plans. (a) Parents may modify the schedule of the time each parent
spends with the child or the decision-making provisions of a parenting plan by agreement. To be enforceable,
modifications must be confirmed by court order. A motion to modify decision-making provisions or the
time each parent spends with the child may be made only within the time limits provided by section 518.18.
(b) The parties may agree, but the court must not require them, to apply the best interests standard in
section 257.025 or 518.17, as applicable, for deciding a motion for modification that would change the
child's primary residence, provided that:
(1) both parties were represented by counsel when the parenting plan was approved; or
(2) the court found the parties were fully informed, the agreement was voluntary, and the parties were
aware of its implications.
(c) If the parties do not agree to apply the best interests standard, section 518.18, paragraph (d), applies.

518.175 PARENTING TIME.
Subdivision 1. General. (a) In all proceedings for dissolution or legal separation, subsequent to the
commencement of the proceeding and continuing thereafter during the minority of the child, the court shall,
upon the request of either parent, grant such parenting time on behalf of the child and a parent as will enable
the child and the parent to maintain a child to parent relationship that will be in the best interests of the child.
The court, when issuing a parenting time order, may reserve a determination as to the future establishment
or expansion of a parent's parenting time. In that event, the best interest standard set forth in subdivision 5,
paragraph (a), shall be applied to a subsequent motion to establish or expand parenting time.
(b) If the court finds, after a hearing, that parenting time with a parent is likely to endanger the child's
physical, mental, or emotional health or safety or impair the child's emotional development, the court shall
restrict parenting time with that parent as to time, place, duration, or supervision and may deny parenting
time entirely, as the circumstances warrant. The court shall consider the age of the child and the child's
relationship with the parent prior to the commencement of the proceeding.
(c) A parent's failure to pay support because of the parent's inability to do so shall not be sufficient cause
for denial of parenting time.
(d) The court may provide that a law enforcement officer or other appropriate person will accompany
a party seeking to enforce or comply with parenting time.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.175
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
30
(e) Upon request of either party, to the extent practicable an order for parenting time must include a
specific schedule for regular parenting time, including the frequency and duration of parenting time and
parenting time during holidays, vacations, and school breaks unless parenting time is restricted, denied, or
reserved.
(f) The court administrator shall provide a form for a pro se motion regarding parenting time disputes,
which includes provisions for indicating the relief requested, an affidavit in which the party may state the
facts of the dispute, and a brief description of the parenting time expeditor process under section 518.1751.
The form may not include a request for a change of custody. The court shall provide instructions on serving
and filing the motion.
(g) In the absence of other evidence, there is a rebuttable presumption that a child must receive a minimum
of at least 25 percent of the parenting time with each parent. For purposes of this paragraph, the percentage
of parenting time may be determined by calculating the number of overnights that a child spends with a
parent or by using a method other than overnights if the parent has significant time periods on separate days
when the child is in the parent's physical custody but does not stay overnight. The court may consider the
age of the child in determining whether a child is with a parent for a significant period of time.
Subd. 1a. Domestic abuse; supervised parenting time. (a) If a parent requests supervised parenting
time under subdivision 1 or 5 and an order for protection under chapter 518B or a similar law of another
state is in effect against the other parent to protect the parent with whom the child resides or the child, the
judge or judicial officer must consider the order for protection in making a decision regarding parenting
time.
(b) The state court administrator, in consultation with representatives of parents and other interested
persons, shall develop standards to be met by persons who are responsible for supervising parenting time.
Either parent may challenge the appropriateness of an individual chosen by the court to supervise parenting
time.
Subd. 2. Rights of children and parents. Upon the request of either parent, the court may inform any
child of the parties, if eight years of age or older, or otherwise of an age of suitable comprehension, of the
rights of the child and each parent under the order or decree or any substantial amendment thereof. The
parent with whom the child resides shall present the child for parenting time with the other parent, at such
times as the court directs.
Subd. 3. Move to another state. (a) The parent with whom the child resides shall not move the residence
of the child to another state except upon order of the court or with the consent of the other parent, if the
other parent has been given parenting time by the decree. If the purpose of the move is to interfere with
parenting time given to the other parent by the decree, the court shall not permit the child's residence to be
moved to another state.
(b) The court shall apply a best interests standard when considering the request of the parent with whom
the child resides to move the child's residence to another state. The factors the court must consider in
determining the child's best interests include, but are not limited to:
(1) the nature, quality, extent of involvement, and duration of the child's relationship with the person
proposing to relocate and with the nonrelocating person, siblings, and other significant persons in the child's
life;
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes31
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.175
(2) the age, developmental stage, needs of the child, and the likely impact the relocation will have on
the child's physical, educational, and emotional development, taking into consideration special needs of the
child;
(3) the feasibility of preserving the relationship between the nonrelocating person and the child through
suitable parenting time arrangements, considering the logistics and financial circumstances of the parties;
(4) the child's preference, taking into consideration the age and maturity of the child;
(5) whether there is an established pattern of conduct of the person seeking the relocation either to
promote or thwart the relationship of the child and the nonrelocating person;
(6) whether the relocation of the child will enhance the general quality of the life for both the custodial
parent seeking the relocation and the child including, but not limited to, financial or emotional benefit or
educational opportunity;
(7) the reasons of each person for seeking or opposing the relocation; and
(8) the effect on the safety and welfare of the child, or of the parent requesting to move the child's
residence, of domestic abuse, as defined in section 518B.01.
(c) The burden of proof is upon the parent requesting to move the residence of the child to another state,
except that if the court finds that the person requesting permission to move has been a victim of domestic
abuse by the other parent, the burden of proof is upon the parent opposing the move. The court must consider
all of the factors in this subdivision in determining the best interests of the child.
Subd. 4. [Repealed, 1996 c 391 art 1 s 6]
Subd. 5. Modification of parenting plan or order for parenting time. (a) If a parenting plan or an
order granting parenting time cannot be used to determine the number of overnights or overnight equivalents
the child has with each parent, the court shall modify the parenting plan or order granting parenting time so
that the number of overnights or overnight equivalents the child has with each parent can be determined.
For purposes of this section, "overnight equivalents" has the meaning given in section 518A.36, subdivision
1.
(b) If modification would serve the best interests of the child, the court shall modify the decision-making
provisions of a parenting plan or an order granting or denying parenting time, if the modification would not
change the child's primary residence. Consideration of a child's best interest includes a child's changing
developmental needs.
(c) Except as provided in section 631.52, the court may not restrict parenting time unless it finds that:
(1) parenting time is likely to endanger the child's physical or emotional health or impair the child's
emotional development; or
(2) the parent has chronically and unreasonably failed to comply with court-ordered parenting time.
A modification of parenting time which increases a parent's percentage of parenting time to an amount that
is between 45.1 to 54.9 percent parenting time is not a restriction of the other parent's parenting time.
(d) If a parent makes specific allegations that parenting time by the other parent places the parent or
child in danger of harm, the court shall hold a hearing at the earliest possible time to determine the need to
modify the order granting parenting time. Consistent with subdivision 1a, the court may require a third party,
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.175
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
32
including the local social services agency, to supervise the parenting time or may restrict a parent's parenting
time if necessary to protect the other parent or child from harm. If there is an existing order for protection
governing the parties, the court shall consider the use of an independent, neutral exchange location for
parenting time.
Subd. 6. Remedies. (a) Each party must follow a court's order for custody and parenting time unless
the parties have made another agreement in writing as defined by section 645.44, subdivision 14.
(b) For the purposes of this subdivision, "court-ordered parenting time" means:
(1) parenting time that a court has ordered, regardless of whether the order is temporary or permanent
and whether family court or juvenile court has issued the order;
(2) an order by a parenting time consultant, parenting coordinator, special master, or other court-appointed
individual who is authorized to establish or modify parenting time; or
(3) a binding agreement or decision under section 518.1751, subdivision 3.
(c) The court shall fully consider providing compensatory parenting time when a parent has intentionally
made a substantial amount of court-ordered parenting time unavailable to the other parent unless providing
the compensatory parenting time is not consistent with the child's best interests. The court must consider all
relevant evidence to determine whether a parent has made a substantial amount of court-ordered parenting
time unavailable to the other parent.
(d) If the court finds that a person has been deprived of court-ordered parenting time under paragraph
(b), the court shall order the parent who has interfered to allow compensatory parenting time to the other
parent. When compensatory parenting time is awarded, additional parenting time must be:
(1) at least of the same type and duration as the deprived parenting time and, at the discretion of the
court, may be in excess of or of a different type than the deprived parenting time;
(2) taken within one year after the deprived parenting time; and
(3) at a time acceptable to the parent deprived of parenting time.
(e) If the court finds that a party has repeatedly and intentionally denied or interfered with court-ordered
parenting time, the court must, in addition to awarding compensatory parenting time, require the party to
reimburse the other party for costs incurred as a result of the party's denial of or interference with court-ordered
parenting time and award reasonable attorney fees to the other party, provided that the court finds that the
party from whom fees, costs, and disbursements are sought has the means to pay them. The court may:
(1) impose a sanction of up to $500 against the party who denied or interfered with parenting time that
is payable to the other party;
(2) modify legal and physical custody of the child by awarding custody of the child to the party whose
parenting time was denied or interfered with, in accordance with the procedures under section 518.18; or
(3) award any other remedy that the court finds to be in the best interests of the children involved.
(f) The court shall provide one or more of the remedies available in paragraph (e), clauses (1) and (2),
if the court finds that a party has repeatedly and intentionally denied or interfered with court-ordered parenting
time after a previous finding that the party repeatedly and intentionally denied or interfered with court-ordered
parenting time.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes33
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.175
(g) If the court makes written findings that any denial of or interference with court-ordered parenting
time was necessary to protect a child's physical or emotional health, the court is not required to comply with
paragraphs (d) to (f).
(h) If the court finds that a party has been denied parenting time and has incurred expenses in connection
with the denied parenting time, the court may require the party who denied parenting time to post a bond in
favor of the other party in the amount of prepaid expenses associated with upcoming planned parenting time.
(i) Proof of an unwarranted denial of or interference with duly established parenting time may constitute
contempt of court and may be sufficient cause for reversal of custody.
(j) All parenting time orders must include notice of the provisions of this subdivision.
(k) The required notice under paragraph (j) must be substantially as follows:
"NOTICE REGARDING COMPLIANCE WITH PARENTING TIME ORDER:
The parties are expected to fully comply with the court's order unless the parties mutually agree otherwise
in writing as defined by Minnesota Statutes, section 645.44, subdivision 14. Pursuant to Minnesota Statutes,
section 518.175, subdivision 6, and Minnesota Statutes, section 518.131, subdivision 11, the parties are
hereby notified that:
(1) The court shall award compensatory parenting time to a parent who has been prevented from exercising
parenting time.
(2) Deprivation of parental rights is a FELONY crime pursuant to Minnesota Statutes, section 609.375.
(3) If the court finds that one parent has repeatedly and intentionally denied or interfered with another
parent's parenting time, then the court shall award attorney fees to the parent who has been denied parenting
time and require the parent who has been denying or interfering with parenting time to pay the other parent
for costs incurred as a result of enforcing the decision.
(4) If the court finds that one parent has repeatedly and intentionally denied or interfered with parenting
time, then the court may also:
(i) transfer custody of the child to the other parent;
(ii) impose a sanction of up to $500 on the parent who repeatedly and intentionally denied or interfered
with parenting time; or
(iii) award other relief as determined to be in the best interests of the children involved."
(l) An order issued under this section requiring reimbursement of costs or fees does not require a party
to have direct contact with another party.
Subd. 7. [Renumbered 518.1752]
Subd. 8. Additional parenting time for child care parent. The court may allow additional parenting
time to a parent to provide child care while the other parent is working if this arrangement is reasonable and
in the best interests of the child, as defined in section 518.17, subdivision 1. In addition, the court shall
consider:
(1) the ability of the parents to cooperate;
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.175
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
34
(2) methods for resolving disputes regarding the care of the child, and the parents' willingness to use
those methods; and
(3) whether domestic abuse, as defined in section 518B.01, has occurred between the parties.

518.1751 PARENTING TIME DISPUTE RESOLUTION.
Subdivision 1. Parenting time expeditor. Upon request of either party, the parties' stipulation, or upon
the court's own motion, the court may appoint a parenting time expeditor to resolve parenting time disputes
that occur under a parenting time order while a matter is pending under this chapter, chapter 257 or 518D,
or after a decree is entered.
Subd. 1a. Exceptions. A party may not be required to refer a parenting time dispute to a parenting time
expeditor under this section if:
(1) one of the parties claims to be the victim of domestic abuse by the other party;
(2) the court determines there is probable cause that one of the parties or a child of the parties has been
physically abused or threatened with physical abuse by the other party; or
(3) the party is unable to pay the costs of the expeditor, as provided under subdivision 2a.
If the court is satisfied that the parties have been advised by counsel and have agreed to use the parenting
time expeditor process and the process does not involve face-to-face meeting of the parties, the court may
direct that the parenting time expeditor process be used.
Subd. 1b. Purpose; definitions. (a) The purpose of a parenting time expeditor is to resolve parenting
time disputes by enforcing, interpreting, clarifying, and addressing circumstances not specifically addressed
by an existing parenting time order and, if appropriate, to make a determination as to whether the existing
parenting time order has been violated. A parenting time expeditor may be appointed to resolve a onetime
parenting time dispute or to provide ongoing parenting time dispute resolution services.
(b) For purposes of this section, "parenting time dispute" means a disagreement among parties about
parenting time with a child, including a dispute about an anticipated denial of future scheduled parenting
time. "Parenting time dispute" includes a claim by a parent that the other parent is not spending time with
a child as well as a claim by a parent that the other parent is denying or interfering with parenting time.
(c) A "parenting time expeditor" is a neutral person authorized to use a mediation-arbitration process to
resolve parenting time disputes. A parenting time expeditor shall attempt to resolve a parenting time dispute
by facilitating negotiations between the parties to promote settlement and, if it becomes apparent that the
dispute cannot be resolved by an agreement of the parties, the parenting time expeditor shall make a decision
resolving the dispute.
Subd. 2. Appointment. (a) The parties may stipulate to the appointment of a parenting time expeditor
or a team of two expeditors without appearing in court by submitting to the court a written agreement
identifying the names of the individuals to be appointed by the court; the nature of the dispute; the
responsibilities of the parenting time expeditor, including whether the expeditor is appointed to resolve a
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes35
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.1751
specific issue or on an ongoing basis; the term of the appointment; and the apportionment of fees and costs.
The court shall review the agreement of the parties.
(b) If the parties cannot agree on a parenting time expeditor, the court shall provide to the parties a copy
of the court administrator's roster of parenting time expeditors and require the parties to exchange the names
of three potential parenting time expeditors by a specific date. If after exchanging names the parties are
unable to agree upon a parenting time expeditor, the court shall select the parenting time expeditor and, in
its discretion, may appoint one expeditor or a team of two expeditors. In the selection process the court must
give consideration to the financial circumstances of the parties and the fees of those being considered as
parenting time expeditors. Preference must be given to persons who agree to volunteer their services or who
will charge a variable fee for services based on the ability of the parties to pay for them.
(c) An order appointing a parenting time expeditor must identify the name of the individual to be
appointed, the nature of the dispute, the responsibilities of the expeditor including whether the expeditor is
appointed to resolve a specific issue or on an ongoing basis, the term of the appointment, the apportionment
of fees, and notice that if the parties are unable to reach an agreement with the assistance of the expeditor,
the expeditor is authorized to make a decision resolving the dispute which is binding upon the parties unless
modified or vacated by the court.
Subd. 2a. Fees. Prior to appointing the parenting time expeditor, the court shall give the parties notice
that the fees of the expeditor will be apportioned among the parties. In its order appointing the expeditor,
the court shall apportion the fees of the expeditor among the parties, with each party bearing the portion of
fees that the court determines is just and equitable under the circumstances. If a party files a pro se motion
regarding a parenting time dispute and there is not a court order that provides for apportionment of the fees
of an expeditor, the court administrator may require the party requesting the appointment of an expeditor to
pay the fees of the expeditor in advance. Neither party may be required to submit a dispute to a visitation
expeditor if the party cannot afford to pay for the fees of an expeditor and an affordable expeditor is not
available, unless the other party agrees to pay the fees. After fees are incurred, a party may by motion request
that the fees be reapportioned on equitable grounds. The court may consider the resources of the parties, the
nature of the dispute, and whether a party acted in bad faith. The court may consider information from the
expeditor in determining bad faith.
Subd. 2b. Roster of parenting time expeditors. Each court administrator shall maintain and make
available to the public and judicial officers a roster of individuals available to serve as parenting time
expeditors, including each individual's name, address, telephone number, and fee charged, if any. A court
administrator shall not place on the roster the name of an individual who has not completed the training
required in subdivision 2c. If the use of a parenting time expeditor is initiated by stipulation of the parties,
the parties may agree upon a person to serve as an expeditor even if that person has not completed the training
described in subdivision 2c. The court may appoint a person to serve as an expeditor even if the person is
not on the court administrator's roster, but may not appoint a person who has not completed the training
described in subdivision 2c, unless so stipulated by the parties. To maintain one's listing on a court
administrator's roster of parenting time expeditors, an individual shall annually submit to the court
administrator proof of completion of continuing education requirements.
Subd. 2c. Training and continuing education requirements. To qualify for listing on a court
administrator's roster of parenting time expeditors, an individual shall complete a minimum of 40 hours of
family mediation training that has been certified by the Minnesota Supreme Court, which must include
certified training in domestic abuse issues as required under Rule 114 of the Minnesota General Rules of
Practice for the District Courts. To maintain one's listing on a court administrator's roster of parenting time
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.1751
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
36
expeditors, an individual shall annually attend three hours of continuing education about alternative dispute
resolution subjects.
Subd. 3. Agreement or decision. (a) Within five days of notice of the appointment, or within five days
of notice of a subsequent parenting time dispute between the same parties, the parenting time expeditor shall
meet with the parties together or separately and shall make a diligent effort to facilitate an agreement to
resolve the dispute. If a parenting time dispute requires immediate resolution, the parenting time expeditor
may confer with the parties through a telephone conference or similar means. An expeditor may make a
decision without conferring with a party if the expeditor made a good faith effort to confer with the party,
but the party chose not to participate in resolution of the dispute.
(b) If the parties do not reach an agreement, the expeditor shall make a decision resolving the dispute
as soon as possible but not later than five days after receiving all information necessary to make a decision
and after the final meeting or conference with the parties. The expeditor is authorized to award compensatory
parenting time under section 518.175, subdivision 6, and may recommend to the court that the noncomplying
party pay attorney's fees, court costs, and other costs under section 518.175, subdivision 6, paragraph (d),
if the parenting time order has been violated. The expeditor shall not lose authority to make a decision if
circumstances beyond the expeditor's control make it impracticable to meet the five-day timelines.
(c) Unless the parties mutually agree, the parenting time expeditor shall not make a decision that is
inconsistent with an existing parenting time order, but may make decisions interpreting or clarifying a
parenting time order, including the development of a specific schedule when the existing court order grants
"reasonable parenting time."
(d) The expeditor shall put an agreement or decision in writing and provide a copy to the parties. The
expeditor may include or omit reasons for the agreement or decision. An agreement of the parties or a
decision of the expeditor is binding on the parties unless vacated or modified by the court. If a party does
not comply with an agreement of the parties or a decision of the expeditor, any party may bring a motion
with the court and shall attach a copy of the parties' written agreement or decision of the expeditor. The
court may enforce, modify, or vacate the agreement of the parties or the decision of the expeditor.
Subd. 4. Other agreements. This section does not preclude the parties from voluntarily agreeing to
submit their parenting time dispute to a neutral third party or from otherwise resolving parenting time disputes
on a voluntary basis.
Subd. 4a. Confidentiality. (a) Statements made and documents produced as part of the parenting time
expeditor process which are not otherwise discoverable are not subject to discovery or other disclosure and
are not admissible into evidence for any purpose at trial or in any other proceeding, including impeachment.
(b) Sworn testimony may be used in subsequent proceedings for any purpose for which it is admissible
under the Rules of Evidence. Parenting time expeditors, and lawyers for the parties to the extent of their
participation in the parenting time expeditor process, must not be subpoenaed or called as witnesses in court
proceedings.

writing at the time of the custody order, the parent with whom the child resides may determine the child's
upbringing, including education, health care, and religious training, unless the court after hearing, finds,

518.179 PARTICIPATION IN CUSTODY OR PARENTING TIME WHEN PERSON CONVICTED
OF CERTAIN OFFENSES.
Subdivision 1. Seeking custody or parenting time. Notwithstanding any contrary provision in section
518.17 or 518.175, if a person seeking child custody or parenting time has been convicted of a crime described

parenting time by that person is in the best interests of the child if:
(1) the conviction occurred within the preceding five years;
(2) the person is currently incarcerated, on probation, or under supervised release for the offense; or
(3) the victim of the crime was a family or household member as defined in section 518B.01, subdivision
2.
If this section applies, the court may not grant custody or parenting time to the person unless it finds
that the custody or parenting time is in the best interests of the child. If the victim of the crime was a family
or household member, the standard of proof is clear and convincing evidence. A guardian ad litem must be
appointed in any case where this section applies.
Subd. 2. Applicable crimes. This section applies to the following crimes or similar crimes under the

518.18 MODIFICATION OF ORDER.
(a) Unless agreed to in writing by the parties, no motion to modify a custody order or parenting plan
may be made earlier than one year after the date of the entry of a decree of dissolution or legal separation
containing a provision dealing with custody, except in accordance with paragraph (c).
(b) If a motion for modification has been heard, whether or not it was granted, unless agreed to in writing
by the parties no subsequent motion may be filed within two years after disposition of the prior motion on
its merits, except in accordance with paragraph (c).
(c) The time limitations prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) shall not prohibit a motion to modify a
custody order or parenting plan if the court finds that there is persistent and willful denial or interference
with parenting time, or has reason to believe that the child's present environment may endanger the child's
physical or emotional health or impair the child's emotional development.
(d) If the court has jurisdiction to determine child custody matters, the court shall not modify a prior
custody order or a parenting plan provision which specifies the child's primary residence unless it finds,
upon the basis of facts, including unwarranted denial of, or interference with, a duly established parenting
time schedule, that have arisen since the prior order or that were unknown to the court at the time of the
prior order, that a change has occurred in the circumstances of the child or the parties and that the modification
is necessary to serve the best interests of the child. In applying these standards the court shall retain the
custody arrangement or the parenting plan provision specifying the child's primary residence that was
established by the prior order unless:
(i) the court finds that a change in the custody arrangement or primary residence is in the best interests
of the child and the parties previously agreed, in a writing approved by a court, to apply the best interests
standard in section 518.17 or 257.025, as applicable; and, with respect to agreements approved by a court
on or after April 28, 2000, both parties were represented by counsel when the agreement was approved or
the court found the parties were fully informed, the agreement was voluntary, and the parties were aware
of its implications;
(ii) both parties agree to the modification;
(iii) the child has been integrated into the family of the petitioner with the consent of the other party;
(iv) the child's present environment endangers the child's physical or emotional health or impairs the
child's emotional development and the harm likely to be caused by a change of environment is outweighed
by the advantage of a change to the child; or
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes41

518.191
(v) the court has denied a request of the primary custodial parent to move the residence of the child to
another state, and the primary custodial parent has relocated to another state despite the court's order.
In addition, a court may modify a custody order or parenting plan under section 631.52.
(e) In deciding whether to modify a prior joint custody order, the court shall apply the standards set forth
in paragraph (d) unless: (1) the parties agree in writing to the application of a different standard, or (2) the
party seeking the modification is asking the court for permission to move the residence of the child to another
state.
(f) If a parent has been granted sole physical custody of a minor and the child subsequently lives with
the other parent, and temporary sole physical custody has been approved by the court or by a court-appointed
referee, the court may suspend the obligor's child support obligation pending the final custody determination.
The court's order denying the suspension of child support must include a written explanation of the reasons
why continuation of the child support obligation would be in the best interests of the child.

518.183 REPLACING CERTAIN ORDERS.
Upon request of both parties the court must modify an order entered under section 518.17 or 518.175
before January 1, 2001, by entering a parenting plan that complies with section 518.1705, unless the court
makes detailed findings that entering a parenting plan is not in the best interests of the child. If only one
party makes the request, the court may modify the order by entering a parenting plan that complies with
section 518.1705. The court must apply the standards in section 518.18 when considering a motion to enter
a parenting plan that would change the child's primary residence. The court must apply the standards in
section 518.17 when considering a motion to enter a parenting plan that would:
(1) change decision-making responsibilities of the parents; or
(2) change the time each parent spends with the child, but not change the child's primary residence.

518.185 AFFIDA VIT PRACTICE.

518.191 SUMMARY REAL ESTATE DISPOSITION JUDGMENT.
Subdivision 1. Abbreviated judgment and decree. If real estate is described in a judgment and decree
of dissolution, the court shall direct either of the parties or their legal counsel to prepare and submit to the
court a proposed summary real estate disposition judgment. Upon approval by the court and filing of the
summary real estate disposition judgment with the court administrator, the court administrator shall provide
to any party upon request certified copies of the summary real estate disposition judgment.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.191
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
42
Subd. 2. Required information. A summary real estate disposition judgment must contain the following
information:
(1) the full caption and file number of the case and the title "Summary Real Estate Disposition Judgment";
(2) the dates of the parties' marriage and of the entry of the judgment and decree of dissolution;
(3) the names of the parties' attorneys or if either or both appeared pro se;
(4) the name of the judge and referee, if any, who signed the order for judgment and decree;
(5) whether the judgment and decree resulted from a stipulation, a default, or a trial and the appearances
at the default or trial;
(6) if the judgment and decree resulted from a stipulation, whether the real property was described by
a legal description;
(7) if the judgment and decree resulted from a default, whether the petition contained the legal description
of the property and whether disposition was made in accordance with the request for relief;
(8) whether the summons and petition were served personally upon the respondent pursuant to the Rules
of Civil Procedure, rule 4.03(a), or section 543.19;
(9) if the summons and petition were served on the respondent only by publication, the name of each
legal newspaper and county in which the summons and petition were published and the dates of publications;
(10) whether either party changed the party's name through the judgment and decree;
(11) the legal description of each parcel of real estate;
(12) the name or names of the persons awarded an interest in each parcel of real estate and a description
of the interest awarded;
(13) liens, mortgages, encumbrances, or other interests in the real estate described in the judgment and
decree; and
(14) triggering or contingent events set forth in the judgment and decree affecting the disposition of
each parcel of real estate.
Subd. 2a. Amended summary real estate disposition judgment. (a) On the court's own motion or on
application by an interested person, the court shall issue an order authorizing the court administrator to issue
an amended summary real estate disposition judgment to correct an erroneous legal description of real estate
contained in the judgment and decree of dissolution.
(b) An application to correct a legal description under this subdivision must contain:
(1) the erroneous legal description contained in the judgment and decree;
(2) the correct legal description of the real estate;
(3) written evidence satisfactory to the court to show the correct legal description, or a request for an
evidentiary hearing to produce evidence of the correct legal description; and
(4) a proposed amended summary real estate disposition judgment.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes43
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.195
(c) The court shall consider an application under this subdivision on an expedited basis. The court's
order must be based on the evidence provided in the application, the evidence produced at an evidentiary
hearing, or the evidence already in the record of the proceeding. If the court is satisfied that an erroneous
legal description should be corrected under this subdivision, the court may issue its order without a hearing
or notice to any person. A filing fee is not required for an application under this subdivision. The court's
order must be treated as an amendment of the court's findings of fact regarding the legal description of the
property in question, without the need to amend the original judgment and decree. The court shall issue the
order if the court specifically finds that the court had jurisdiction over the respondent in the dissolution
proceeding and that the property was sufficiently identified in the original proceedings to prevent prejudice
to the rights of either party to the dissolution and that the amendment will not prejudice their rights. The
court's order is effective retroactive to the date of entry of the original judgment and decree of dissolution.
(d) An amended summary real estate disposition judgment must be treated the same as the prior summary
real estate disposition judgment for all purposes.
(e) On request by any interested person, the court administrator shall provide a certified copy of an
amended summary real estate disposition judgment showing the correct legal description of the real property
affected by the judgment and decree.
(f) This subdivision may not be used to add omitted property to a judgment and decree of dissolution,
unless the court determines that the omitted property is an integral or appurtenant part of real property already
properly included in the judgment and decree.
Subd. 3. Court order. An order or provision in a judgment and decree that provides that the judgment
and decree must be recorded in the office of the county recorder or filed in the office of the registrar of titles
means, if a summary real estate disposition judgment has been approved by the court, that the summary real
estate disposition judgment, rather than the judgment and decree, must be recorded in the office of the county
recorder or filed in the office of the registrar of titles. The recorder or registrar of titles is not responsible
for determining if a summary real estate disposition judgment has been approved by the court.
Subd. 4. Transfer of property. The summary real estate disposition judgment operates as a conveyance
and transfer of each interest in the real estate in the manner and to the extent described in the summary real
estate disposition judgment. A summary real estate disposition judgment, or an amended summary real estate
disposition judgment that supersedes an earlier judgment, is prima facie evidence of the facts stated in the
summary real estate disposition judgment. A purchaser for value without notice of any defect in the dissolution
proceedings may rely on a summary real estate disposition judgment or a later amended summary real estate
disposition judgment to establish the facts stated in the judgment.
Subd. 5. Conflict. If a conflict exists between the judgment and decree and the summary real estate
disposition judgment, the summary real estate disposition judgment recorded in the office of the county
recorder or filed in the office of the registrar of titles controls as to the interest acquired in real estate by any
subsequent purchaser in good faith and for a valuable consideration, who is in possession of the interest or
whose interest is recorded with the county recorder or registrar of titles, before the recording of the judgment
and decree in the same office.

MAINTENANCE, SUPPORT, PROPERTY
518.552 MAINTENANCE.
Subdivision 1. Grounds. In a proceeding for dissolution of marriage or legal separation, or in a proceeding
for maintenance following dissolution of the marriage by a court which lacked personal jurisdiction over
the absent spouse and which has since acquired jurisdiction, the court may grant a maintenance order for
either spouse if it finds that the spouse seeking maintenance:
(a) lacks sufficient property, including marital property apportioned to the spouse, to provide for
reasonable needs of the spouse considering the standard of living established during the marriage, especially,
but not limited to, a period of training or education;
(b) is unable to provide adequate self-support, after considering the standard of living established during
the marriage and all relevant circumstances; or
(c) is the custodian of a child whose condition or circumstances make it appropriate that the custodian
not be required to seek employment outside the home.
Subd. 2. Amount of maintenance. The maintenance order shall be in amounts and for periods of time,
either transitional or indefinite, as the court deems just, without regard to marital misconduct, and after
considering all relevant factors including:
(a) the financial resources of the party seeking maintenance, including marital property apportioned to
the party, and the party's ability to meet needs independently, including the extent to which a provision for
support of a child living with the party includes a sum for that party as custodian;
(b) the time necessary to acquire sufficient education or training to enable the party seeking maintenance
to find appropriate employment, and the probability, given the party's age and skills, of completing education
or training and becoming fully or partially self-supporting;
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes49
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.552
(c) the standard of living established during the marriage and the extent to which the standard of living
was funded by debt;
(d) the duration of the marriage and the earnings, seniority, benefits, and other employment opportunities
forgone by the spouse seeking maintenance to support the other spouse or children and the length of absence
from employment and the extent to which any education, skills, or experience have become outmoded and
earning capacity has become permanently diminished;
(e) the age, and physical, mental, or chemical health of both spouses;
(f) the ability of the spouse from whom maintenance is sought to meet needs while meeting those of the
spouse seeking maintenance;
(g) the contribution of a spouse in furtherance of the other party's employment or business; and
(h) the need and ability of each spouse to prepare for retirement and the anticipated time of retirement.
Subd. 3. Duration of maintenance. (a) A maintenance award may be transitional or indefinite. An
award of temporary maintenance issued before August 1, 2024, is deemed transitional maintenance. An
award of permanent maintenance issued before August 1, 2024, is deemed indefinite maintenance.
Maintenance awarded during the pendency of an initial proceeding for dissolution or legal separation pursuant
to section 518.131 is deemed temporary maintenance.
(b) For purposes of this subdivision, "length of the marriage" means the period from the date of the
marriage until the date of the commencement of the action.
(c) The court must determine the duration of maintenance based on the length of the marriage as follows:
(1) when the length of the marriage is less than five years, it is rebuttably presumed that no maintenance
should be awarded;
(2) when the length of the marriage is at least five years and less than 20 years, it is rebuttably presumed
that transitional maintenance should be awarded with a duration of no longer than one-half the length of the
marriage if the factors set forth in subdivision 1 support an award of maintenance; and
(3) when the length of the marriage is 20 years or more, it is rebuttably presumed that indefinite
maintenance should be awarded if the factors set forth in subdivision 1 support an award of maintenance.
Subd. 4. Reopening maintenance awards. Section 518.145, subdivision 2, applies to awards of spousal
maintenance.
Subd. 5. Private agreements. The parties may expressly preclude or limit modification of maintenance
through a stipulation, if the court makes specific findings that the stipulation is fair and equitable, is supported
by consideration described in the findings, and that full disclosure of each party's financial circumstances
has occurred. The stipulation must be made a part of the judgment and decree or a post-decree stipulated
order. The parties may restore the court's authority or jurisdiction to award or modify maintenance through
a binding stipulation.
Subd. 5a. Maintenance on death or remarriage. Unless otherwise agreed in writing or expressly
provided in the decree, the obligation to pay future maintenance is terminated upon the death of either party
or the remarriage of the party receiving maintenance.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.552
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
50
Subd. 5b. Modification. (a) Upon the motion of either of the parties, the court may modify the amount
and duration of maintenance and may issue an order that the court might have issued in the original proceeding,
except as otherwise provided in this subdivision.
(b) The terms of a maintenance order may be modified upon a showing of one or more of the following
circumstances that make the terms of the existing order unreasonable and unfair:
(1) substantially increased or decreased gross income of an obligor or obligee;
(2) substantially increased or decreased need of an obligor or obligee; or
(3) substantial changes in the federal or state tax laws that affect spousal maintenance.
(c) Upon a motion to modify maintenance, including a motion to extend the duration of a maintenance
award, the court shall apply, in addition to all other relevant factors, the factors for an award of maintenance
under subdivisions 1 to 3 that exist at the time of the motion.
(d) Unless the court adopts an alternative effective date under paragraph (f), a modification of
maintenance, including interest that accrued pursuant to section 548.091, may be made retroactive:
(1) for any period during which the petitioning party has a motion for modification that is pending;
(2) from the date that the notice of the motion to modify was served on the responding party;
(3) from the date that the notice of the motion to modify was served on the public authority if public
assistance is being received; or
(4) from the date that the notice of the motion to modify was served on the county attorney if the county
attorney is the attorney of record.
(e) The court need not hold an evidentiary hearing on a motion to modify maintenance.
(f) The court may select an alternative effective date for a maintenance order if the parties enter into a
binding agreement for an alternative effective date. The court's adoption of an alternative effective date
under this paragraph must not be considered a retroactive modification of maintenance.
Subd. 6. Cohabitation. (a) Spousal maintenance may be modified pursuant to subdivision 5b based on
the cohabitation by the maintenance obligee with another adult following dissolution of the marriage. The
modification may consist of a reduction, suspension, reservation, or termination of maintenance. In
determining if maintenance should be modified due to cohabitation, the court shall consider:
(1) whether the obligee would marry the cohabitant but for the maintenance award;
(2) the economic benefit the obligee derives from the cohabitation;
(3) the length of the cohabitation and the likely future duration of the cohabitation; and
(4) the economic impact on the obligee if maintenance is modified and the cohabitation ends.
(b) The court must not modify a maintenance award based solely on cohabitation if a marriage between
the obligee and the cohabitant would be prohibited under section 517.03, subdivision 1, clause (2) or (3). A
modification under this subdivision must be precluded or limited to the extent the parties have entered into
a private agreement under subdivision 5.
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes51
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.58
(c) A motion to modify a spousal maintenance award on the basis of cohabitation may not be brought
within one year of the date of entry of the decree of dissolution or legal separation that orders spousal
maintenance, unless the parties have agreed in writing that a motion may be brought or the court finds that
failing to allow the motion to proceed would create an extreme hardship for one of the parties.
Subd. 7. Retirement. (a) If a party retires, spousal maintenance may be modified. The modification of
maintenance may consist of a reduction, suspension, reservation, or termination of maintenance.
(b) In determining if maintenance should be modified due to a party's retirement, the court shall consider:
(1) whether the retirement is in good faith or is an unjustifiable self-limitation of income;
(2) whether the party has attained the age to receive the party's full retirement benefits under section
216 of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, section 416, or the customary age for retirement
in the party's occupation;
(3) whether a party has reasonably and prudently managed the party's assets since the dissolution of the
marriage; and
(4) the financial resources available to both parties.
(c) It is presumed that when a party has attained the age to receive the party's full retirement benefits
under section 216 of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title 42, section 416, or the customary age
for retirement in the party's occupation, the party will use both income and assets to meet the party's needs.
(d) A party must not be presumed to have retired in bad faith or to have unjustifiably self-limited the
party's income in the event that the party's retirement is occurring on or after the date the party attains the
age to receive full retirement benefits under section 216 of the Social Security Act, United States Code, title
42, section 416, or the customary age for retirement in the party's occupation.
(e) A motion to modify maintenance due to retirement may be brought before a party actually retires
provided that the moving party specifies the date by which the party's retirement will occur. The court may
then make the modification effective as of the actual date of retirement.
Subd. 8. Form. The state court administrator's office shall prepare and make available to court
administrators, obligors, and persons to whom spousal maintenance is owed a form to be submitted in support
of a motion for a modification of an order for maintenance or for contempt of court.

518.58 DIVISION OF MARITAL PROPERTY.
Subdivision 1. General. Upon a dissolution of a marriage, an annulment, or in a proceeding for disposition
of property following a dissolution of marriage by a court which lacked personal jurisdiction over the absent
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.58
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
52
spouse or lacked jurisdiction to dispose of the property and which has since acquired jurisdiction, the court
shall make a just and equitable division of the marital property of the parties without regard to marital
misconduct, after making findings regarding the division of the property. The court shall base its findings
on all relevant factors including the length of the marriage, any prior marriage of a party, the age, health,
station, occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, needs,
opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets, and income of each party. The court shall also consider
the contribution of each in the acquisition, preservation, depreciation or appreciation in the amount or value
of the marital property, as well as the contribution of a spouse as a homemaker. It shall be conclusively
presumed that each spouse made a substantial contribution to the acquisition of income and property while
they were living together as spouses. The court may also award to either spouse the household goods and
furniture of the parties, whether or not acquired during the marriage. The court shall value marital assets for
purposes of division between the parties as of the day of the initially scheduled prehearing settlement
conference, unless a different date is agreed upon by the parties, or unless the court makes specific findings
that another date of valuation is fair and equitable. If there is a substantial change in value of an asset between
the date of valuation and the final distribution, the court may adjust the valuation of that asset as necessary
to effect an equitable distribution.
Subd. 1a. Transfer, encumbrance, concealment, or disposition of marital assets. During the pendency
of a marriage dissolution, separation, or annulment proceeding, or in contemplation of commencing a
marriage dissolution, separation, or annulment proceeding, each party owes a fiduciary duty to the other for
any profit or loss derived by the party, without the consent of the other, from a transaction or from any use
by the party of the marital assets. If the court finds that a party to a marriage, without consent of the other
party, has in contemplation of commencing, or during the pendency of, the current dissolution, separation,
or annulment proceeding, transferred, encumbered, concealed, or disposed of marital assets except in the
usual course of business or for the necessities of life, the court shall compensate the other party by placing
both parties in the same position that they would have been in had the transfer, encumbrance, concealment,
or disposal not occurred. The burden of proof under this subdivision is on the party claiming that the other
party transferred, encumbered, concealed, or disposed of marital assets in contemplation of commencing or
during the pendency of the current dissolution, separation, or annulment proceeding, without consent of the
claiming party, and that the transfer, encumbrance, concealment, or disposal was not in the usual course of
business or for the necessities of life. In compensating a party under this section, the court, in dividing the
marital property, may impute the entire value of an asset and a fair return on the asset to the party who
transferred, encumbered, concealed, or disposed of it. Use of a power of attorney, or the absence of a
restraining order against the transfer, encumbrance, concealment, or disposal of marital property is not
available as a defense under this subdivision.
Subd. 2. Award of nonmarital property. If the court finds that either spouse's resources or property,
including the spouse's portion of the marital property as defined in section 518.003, subdivision 3b, are so
inadequate as to work an unfair hardship, considering all relevant circumstances, the court may, in addition
to the marital property, apportion up to one-half of the property otherwise excluded under section 518.003,
subdivision 3b, clauses (a) to (d), to prevent the unfair hardship. If the court apportions property other than
marital property, it shall make findings in support of the apportionment. The findings shall be based on all
relevant factors including the length of the marriage, any prior marriage of a party, the age, health, station,
occupation, amount and sources of income, vocational skills, employability, estate, liabilities, needs, and
opportunity for future acquisition of capital assets and income of each party.
Subd. 3. Sale or distribution while proceeding pending. (a) If the court finds that it is necessary to
preserve the marital assets of the parties, the court may order the sale of the homestead of the parties or the
sale of other marital assets, as the individual circumstances may require, during the pendency of a proceeding
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes53
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
518.581
for a dissolution of marriage or an annulment. If the court orders a sale, it may further provide for the
disposition of the funds received from the sale during the pendency of the proceeding.
(b) The court may order a partial distribution of marital assets during the pendency of a proceeding for
a dissolution of marriage or an annulment for good cause shown or upon the request of both parties, provided
that the court shall fully protect the interests of the other party.
Subd. 4. Pension plans. (a) The division of marital property that represents pension plan benefits or
rights in the form of future pension plan payments:
(1) is payable only to the extent of the amount of the pension plan benefit payable under the terms of
the plan;
(2) is not payable for a period that exceeds the time that pension plan benefits are payable to the pension
plan benefit recipient;
(3) is not payable in a lump-sum amount from defined benefit pension plan assets attributable in any
fashion to a spouse with the status of an active member, deferred retiree, or benefit recipient of a pension
plan;
(4) if the former spouse to whom the payments are to be made dies prior to the end of the specified
payment period with the right to any remaining payments accruing to an estate or to more than one survivor,
is payable only to a trustee on behalf of the estate or the group of survivors for subsequent apportionment
by the trustee; and
(5) in the case of defined benefit public pension plan benefits or rights, may not commence until the
public plan member submits a valid application for a public pension plan benefit and the benefit becomes
payable.
(b) The individual retirement account plans established under chapter 354B may provide in its plan
document, if published and made generally available, for an alternative marital property division or distribution
of individual retirement account plan assets. If an alternative division or distribution procedure is provided,
it applies in place of paragraph (a), clause (5).
(c) If liquid or readily liquidated marital property other than property representing vested pension benefits
or rights is available, the court, so far as possible, shall divide the property representing vested pension
benefits or rights by the disposition of an equivalent amount of the liquid or readily liquidated property.
(d) If sufficient liquid or readily liquidated marital property other than property representing vested
pension benefits or rights is not available, the court may order the revocation of the designation of an optional
annuity beneficiary in pension plans specified in section 356.48 or in any other pension plan in which
plan-governing law or governing documents allow revocation of an optional annuity in marital dissolution
or annulment situations.

518.581 SURVIVING SPOUSE BENEFIT.
Subdivision 1. Award of benefit. If a current or former employee's marriage is dissolved, the court may
order the employee, the employee's pension plan, or both, to pay amounts as part of the division of pension
Official Publication of the State of Minnesota
Revisor of Statutes518.581
MINNESOTA STATUTES 2024
54
rights that the court may make under section 518.58, or as an award of maintenance in the form of a percentage
of periodic or other payments or in the form of a fixed dollar amount. The court may, as part of the order,
award a former spouse all or part of a survivor benefit unless the plan does not allow by law the payment
of a surviving spouse benefit to a former spouse.
Subd. 2. Payment of funds by retirement plan. (a) If the court has ordered that a spouse has an interest
in a pension plan, the court may order the pension plan to withhold payment of a refund upon termination
of employment or lump-sum distribution to the extent of the spouse's interest in the plan, or to provide
survivor benefits ordered by the court.
(b) The court may not order the pension plan to:
(1) pay more than the equivalent of one surviving spouse benefit, regardless of the number of spouses
or former spouses who may be sharing in a portion of the total benefit;
(2) pay surviving spouse benefits under circumstances where the plan member does not have a right to
elect surviving spouse benefits;
(3) pay surviving spouse benefits to a former spouse if the former spouse would not be eligible for
benefits under the terms of the plan; or
(4) order survivor benefits which, when combined with the annuity or benefit payable to the pension
plan member, exceed the actuarial equivalent value of the normal retirement annuity form, determined under
the plan documents of the pension plan then in effect and the actuarial assumptions then in effect for
calculating optional annuity forms by the pension plan or for calculating the funding requirements of the
pension plan if no optional annuity forms are provided by the pension plan.
(c) If more than one spouse or former spouse is entitled to a surviving spouse benefit, the pension plan
shall pay each spouse a portion of the benefit based on the ratio of the number of years the spouse was
married to the plan member to the total number of years the plan member was married to spouses who are

present.

appointed by the family court. A mediator must be a member of the professional staff of a family court,

mediation proceeding, the mediator may recommend to the court that an investigation be conducted under
section 518.167, or that other action be taken to assist the parties to resolve the controversy before hearing
on the issues. The mediator may not conduct the investigation or evaluation unless: (1) the parties agree in
writing, executed after the termination of mediation, that the mediator may conduct the investigation or
evaluation, or (2) there is no other person reasonably available to conduct the investigation or evaluation.
The mediator may recommend that mutual restraining orders be issued in appropriate cases, pending
determination of the controversy, to protect the well-being of the children involved in the controversy.
Subd. 7. Mediation agreement. An agreement reached by the parties as a result of mediation shall be
discussed by the parties with their attorneys, if any, and the approved agreement may then be included in
the marital dissolution decree or other stipulation submitted to the court. An agreement reached by the parties
as a result of mediation may not be presented to the court nor made enforceable unless the parties and their
counsel, if any, consent to its presentation to the court, and the court adopts the agreement.
Subd. 8. Rules. Each court shall adopt rules to implement this section, and shall compile and maintain
a list of mediators.

may apply for support and collection services, file a contempt motion, or obtain a judgment as provided
in Minnesota Statutes, section 548.091.

may be modified, increased, or decreased. Any modification will only take effect when it is ordered by
the court, and will only relate back to the time that a motion is filed. Either the obligor or obligee may
