### From the Introduction (Page 19)
*"The abuse of women sends shock waves through the lives of children as well. Experts estimate that 5 million children per year witness an assault on their mothers, an experience that can leave them traumatized. Children exposed to violence at home show higher rates of school behavior and attention problems, aggression, substance abuse, depression, and many other measures of childhood distress. Abuse of women has been found to be a cause of roughly one-third of divorces among couples with children and one-half of divorces where custody is disputed."*

- **Relevance**: This passage highlights the profound impact of abuse on children and links it directly to coparenting challenges, noting that abuse contributes significantly to divorces involving custody disputes, a key aspect of post-separation cooperation.

### From "The Mystery" (Page 20)
*"Counseling abusive men is difficult work. They are usually very reluctant to face up to the damage that they have been causing women, and often children as well, and hold on tightly to their excuses and victim blaming. As you will see in the pages ahead, they become attached to the various privileges they earn through mistreating their partners, and they have habits of mind that make it difficult for them to imagine being in a respectful and equal relationship with a woman."*

*"In recent years, through my work as a child abuse investigator and as a custody evaluator for various courts, I have come to interact in a new way with families affected by abusive men. I share some of the insights I have gained through these experiences in Chapter 10, which examines the experiences of children who are exposed to abusive men—usually their fathers or stepfathers—and the ways in which some abusers continue their patterns of controlling and intimidating behavior through custody actions in the family courts."*

- **Relevance**: These excerpts emphasize the difficulty abusive men have in changing their behavior, which affects their ability to coparent respectfully. The mention of custody actions indicates how abusive patterns persist post-separation, complicating cooperation with a former spouse.

- **Relevance**: Repeated here, this text underscores the focus on children’s exposure to abusive fathers and the use of custody actions as a means of control, directly relevant to coparenting dynamics with a former spouse.

### From "Abusive Men as Parents" (Pages 330-332)
*"behind the cascade of accusations and counteraccusations, lost in our panic as we see a woman being repeatedly psychologically hammered or physically beaten, we can forget that the abuser has other victims too. The children can become invisible. The police who go on a domestic abuse call sometimes have been known to forget to even ask whether there are children in the home. These children recede into the corners, trying to keep themselves safe, and may remain unnoticed until they are old enough to try to jump in to protect their mothers.*

*As is true with almost every approach to abuse, we have to begin by breaking the silence. Ask the mother privately how she feels her children are being affected by the man’s behavior and by the tension it creates. Does he abuse her in front of them? How do they react? What are her concerns about them? What does she feel they need? (Remember, think with her, not for her.)*

*Break secrecy with the children as well. Let them know that you are aware of what is happening and that you care about their feelings. Ask:*
- *“How are things going at home for you?”*
- *“Is it hard for you when your parents argue?”*
- *“What happens when they get mad at each other?”*
- *“Does anyone at your house ever hurt any one else’s feelings, or frighten anyone?”*
- *“Would you like to tell me about that?”*

*Even if the child answers no to all of your inquiries, you have demonstrated that he or she matters to you and that you understand that the abuse—without calling it that—can be hurtful or frightening. Then leave the door open to future communication by saying: “You can tell me about your life at home any time you want. It’s okay to talk about it. Children can get upset sometimes when their parents argue.”*

*Notice that I recommend using soft terms that neither name abuse nor assign responsibility for it until you find out how much the child knows. This language is important to avoid alerting children to painful dynamics of which they may not be aware. This guideline should be reversed, however, if the child does disclose abuse directly to you or if you know that he or she has directly witnessed explicit verbal or physical abuse toward the mother. Then it becomes important not to use neutral terms; children of abused women already feel that they themselves and their mothers are at least partly at fault, and you do not want to reinforce those hurtful misconceptions. So once the secret is out, avoid evenhanded language such as the problems between your parents or the mean things they sometimes do to each other.*

*Children do need to hear the following messages:*
- *“It’s not your fault if someone in the family says mean things or hurts someone.”*
- *“It’s not your mother’s fault if someone treats her badly.”*
- *“No one should ever blame you for being mean to you or hurting you.”*
- *“A child can’t really protect his or her mother, and it isn’t the child’s job.”*

*The term abuse doesn’t mean anything to children younger than ten or twelve but may be useful in speaking with teenagers. In general, descriptions work better than labels.*

*If the abuser is the children’s father or father figure, take particular caution not to speak badly of him as a person but only to name and criticize his actions. Children do not want to hear that their dad is mean, selfish, or bad. In cases where the abuser is dangerous, it is helpful to discuss the risks with the children, both to help them protect themselves and to validate their reality. However, even a violent, dangerous abuser is a human being, and children tend to be acutely tuned in to the humanity of anyone they know well. Don’t talk about him as if he were a monster. You can say, for example, “Your dad has a problem that makes him unsafe sometimes, doesn’t he?” These are terms that make sense to children.*

*Those community members who work with the children of abused women in a professional capacity, such as teachers, police officers, therapists, or court employees, can increase their effectiveness by being sensitive to the family dynamics that partner abuse creates and by remembering how manipulative abusers can be. Too many children of abused women are labeled “ADD” or “ADHD” and given medication instead of receiving the assistance they need. Children need us to take an interest in their predicament, help them to learn positive values, and support their crucial connection to their mothers."*

- **Relevance**: This section from Chapter 10, "Abusive Men as Parents," directly addresses coparenting by focusing on how an abusive father’s behavior affects children and the mother’s efforts to parent them. It provides guidance on supporting children and the mother, which is critical for effective coparenting with an abusive ex-spouse, emphasizing the need to maintain the mother-child bond and navigate the father’s influence carefully.

### From the Resources Section (Pages 341-344)
#### About Children of Abused Women
*"Childhood Experiences of Domestic Violence, by Caroline McGee (Jessica Kingsley).*  
*Although this is a professional book, it is very readable and compassionate. McGee understands the challenges an abused mother faces. Told largely in the words of mothers and children themselves, this is the single best introduction I have found to the experiences of children exposed to an abusive man, with extensive guidance for how to effectively assist them to safety and recovery."*

*"The Batterer as Parent: Addressing the Impact of Domestic Violence on Family Dynamics, by Lundy Bancroft and Jay Silverman (Sage Publications).*  
*Although this professional book focuses on physically abusive men, the great majority of what we cover applies to verbally abusive and controlling men as well. We explain how an abusive man can affect the relationships between a mother and her children and between siblings, and how abusers may try to continue their control through the children postseparation. Abused mothers, including those involved in the family court system, report finding this book both validating and helpful."*

*"Children Who See Too Much: Lessons From the Child Witness to Violence Project, by Betsy McAlister Groves (Beacon Press).*  
*This book is for parents or professionals who are assisting children who have been exposed to serious physical violence, including domestic violence, to help them understand children’s emotional reactions and their recovery needs. It is brief but very clear and helpful."*

- **Relevance**: These resources provide in-depth support for understanding how abusive men impact coparenting dynamics, particularly post-separation, by affecting mother-child relationships and using children as tools of control.

#### About Child Custody, Divorce, and Child Support
*"Resource Center on Domestic Violence: Child Protection and Custody, operated by the National Council of Juvenile and Family Court Judges. 1-800-527-3223.*  
*The Resource Center offers a free packet of information for abused women in custody and visitation litigation. It does not become involved in specific cases or provide legal advice. The Center also offers a book called Managing Your Divorce that helps women prepare for the process of resolving child custody, visitation, and child support."*

*"Women and Children Last: Custody Disputes and the Family “Justice” System, by Georgina Taylor, Jan Barnsley, and Penny Goldsmith of the Vancouver (BC) Custody and Access Support and Advocacy Association.*  
*This excellent book prepares abused mothers for the difficult emotional and legal challenges of family court litigation, to help increase their ability to keep their children safe and maintain custody. Advocates and concerned community members can also benefit from the explanations of how the family court system works and why abused women can find the environment so hostile. (For ordering information, call Vancouver Status of Women at (604) 255-6554.)"*

*"The Battered Mothers Testimony Project: A Human Rights Report on Child Custody and Domestic Violence.*  
*This activist project interviewed forty abused women about their experiences of being revictimized by family courts through the abuser’s use of custody and visitation litigation, and also interviewed numerous judges, custody evaluators, and advocates. The project report, which exposes these systemic abuses as violations of women’s internationally recognized human rights, is available from: Publication Office, Wellesley Centers for Women, Wellesley College, (781) 283-2510, or at www.wcwonline.org."*

*"Small Justice: Little Justice in America’s Family Courts,” a video by Garland Waller of Boston University.*  
*This one-hour video documents three cases in which abused women faced systematic mistreatment by family courts as they attempted to protect their children from domestic violence and sexual abuse. This well-made and carefully researched film is an important resource for community members working for court reforms. (Available from Intermedia, 1-800-553-8336)"*

*"Divorced from Justice: The Abuse of Women and Children by Divorce Lawyers and Judges, by Karen Winner (Regan Books).*  
*This is another book that is out of print, but you can find it at libraries, used-book stores, or online. The stories are painful ones, and this makes the book heavy reading, but Winner offers crucial advice to women and to anyone who is trying to help them, and she also gives important suggestions to people interested in working for court reform."*

*"The Hostage Child: Sex Abuse Allegations in Custody Disputes, by Leora Rosen and Michelle Etlin (Indiana University Press).*  
*An eye-opening education for people interested in working toward family court reform, this book documents the obstacles that abused women can encounter while attempting to protect their children from abuse, even in cases where extensive evidence exists. (I don’t recommend this book for abused women to read themselves if they are currently involved in litigation—it’s very frightening, and most cases don’t go as badly as the ones presented here.)"*

*"National Child Support Enforcement Association*  
*444 North Capitol St., Suite 414*  
*Washington DC 20001-1512*  
*(202) 624-8180 www.ncsea.org*

### Analysis and Context
The document, *Why Does He Do That?* by Lundy Bancroft, focuses on understanding abusive men, with significant attention to their roles as parents and ex-partners. The extracted text addresses:
- **Impact on Children**: How children are affected by witnessing abuse and the importance of supporting their relationship with the non-abusive parent (typically the mother), which is foundational to coparenting.
- **Custody and Legal Challenges**: The frequent use of custody and visitation litigation by abusive ex-spouses to continue control, highlighting the adversarial nature of cooperation in such cases.
- **Guidance for Coparenting**: Practical advice on communicating with children about their abusive parent without undermining their perception of him as a person, which is critical for maintaining a cooperative stance where possible.
- **Resources**: Extensive listings to support abused women in navigating coparenting challenges, particularly through legal and emotional support systems.

Due to truncation (e.g., 744,596 characters missing on Page 330), some detailed content from Chapter 10 and other sections (e.g., "The Abusive Man and Breaking Up" or "The Abusive Man and the Legal System") is unavailable. However, the available text provides a robust foundation for understanding coparenting and cooperation with a former spouse in the context of abuse.
