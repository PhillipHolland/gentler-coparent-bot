### Another Cancelled Visitation with Seven Minutes Notice

Today was supposed to be a visitation day for my daughters with their father, but once again, he cancelled with only seven minutes' notice. This has become a frustratingly familiar pattern. The girls were already dressed, excited, and waiting by the door when I received a text from him saying he couldn't make it. No explanation, no apology—just a blunt cancellation.

This isn't the first time he's done this. In fact, it's the third time in the past two months. Each time, he gives little to no notice, leaving me to deal with the emotional fallout. My oldest daughter, who is now 10, is starting to understand that her father is unreliable. She tries to hide her disappointment, but I can see it in her eyes. My youngest, who is 7, still gets excited every time, only to be let down again. It's heartbreaking to watch.

I've tried to talk to him about the impact this has on the girls, but he dismisses my concerns. He accuses me of being dramatic and says that the girls are "fine." But they're not fine. They're confused, hurt, and beginning to question why their father doesn't seem to prioritize them.

I've documented every instance of cancelled visitation, every late arrival, and every broken promise. I have a binder full of text messages, emails, and notes from the girls' therapist. But despite all this evidence, the family court system seems reluctant to take action. They tell me that he has "rights" as a father, but what about the rights of my daughters to have a stable, reliable parent?

I'm exhausted from fighting this battle. Every time I think we're making progress, something like this happens, and I'm reminded that the system is broken. It's not designed to protect children; it's designed to protect parental rights, even when those parents are clearly not acting in the best interest of their children.

But I won't give up. I'll keep documenting, keep advocating, and keep fighting for my daughters. They deserve better, and I'll do whatever it takes to ensure they have the safe, stable, and loving environment they need to thrive.

This captures the essence of the incident—a last-minute cancellation that left the children disappointed and the mother frustrated—while reflecting the broader struggle of dealing with an unreliable co-parent and a challenging legal system. The tone is personal and emotional, underscoring the ongoing difficulties and the determination to persevere for the sake of the children.
