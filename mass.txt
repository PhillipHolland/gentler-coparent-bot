INTRODUCTION
Divorce is the legal process by which a married couple separates and becomes two individuals instead of a single unit.
Through a divorce, the couple’s property and debts can be divided between them. In addition, their obligations and
rights in connection with their children and toward each other can be defined. When the divorce becomes final, they
can marry other people. Sometimes, if an annulment is granted, the parties will be considered to have never been
married to each other. However, when there are unemancipated children in the family, the parties often have not
severed all ties but rather redefined them. Generally, the divorced parents of minor children will continue to have
financial, emotional, and legal connections. Checklist 5.1 provides a list of items to review when preparing and
filing for divorce.
WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIVORCE AND A LEGAL
SEPARATION?
The purpose of a divorce is to become unmarried. Through a divorce you can also resolve many other issues, such as
custody or alimony. In certain cases, there is just a divorce—a legal acknowledgment that the parties are no longer
married.
In Massachusetts, there is no such thing as a legal separation. However, you can decide how you are going to live
apart from your spouse in a separate support action, including the amount of support to be paid and with whom the
children will live. In this scenario, you would still be married to one another and could not remarry. Separate support
makes sense when, for religious or psychological reasons, one person may want to define the terms on which the
couple lives apart without getting divorced.
Unmarried parents can resolve issues of custody, parenting time, and child support, but you cannot resolve property
division or alimony. Additionally, you can choose to not end the marriage and file a complaint for separate support
or a complaint for support pursuant to G.L. c. 209, § 32F. This action is not often used between married persons, but
may be filed when, for legal reasons, the court could not hear a divorce but could decide on custody. See
“Jurisdiction,” below.
For most people, if you plan to live apart and do not foresee reconciling, divorce is the most reasonable approach.
126 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
JURISDICTION
As elaborated upon below, the questions of jurisdiction are frequently confusing, even to some lawyers. There are
two requirements that must be met before a court can order a party to do something: the court must have power over
the parties in the case and it must also have power over the subject matter of the case. In certain cases, the court may
make decisions over child custody or may terminate the marital status of two parties, but it cannot stray beyond
those subjects. You may wish to think of the courts as having powers that are limited in certain ways. The power
over a person is different from the power over a case. If your spouse does not live in Massachusetts and, after
reading this section, you still do not understand jurisdiction issues, you should consult an attorney.
In order for a state court to make decisions about you and your family, it must have the power to make those
decisions. This power is called jurisdiction. To decide whether a court has jurisdiction, two questions must be
answered. The first question is whether the defendant has enough of a relationship with the state so that the state will
have the power to issue orders that are binding on the defendant. The second question is whether the case has
enough ties to the state that it is fair for the specific issue or issues to be decided there. These two questions sound
similar but have important legal differences.
Whether the state has the power to issue orders that are binding on the defendant is a question of personal
jurisdiction. For the court to obtain personal jurisdiction over the defendant, the state must have had enough contact
with the defendant for it to be fair to have the state decide the case. As an example, imagine that your wife used to
live in Nebraska; her mother still lives there, and when she leaves the marriage, she goes to Nebraska. You,
however, have never been to Nebraska and you do not want to go there now. It would not be fair if your wife could
file a divorce in Nebraska and force you to go there to argue about paying alimony and dividing up marital property.
Because you have no contacts with Nebraska, the Nebraska court cannot obtain personal jurisdiction over you and
the case will not be heard there. However, if you lived together in Massachusetts and you now live in Massachusetts,
you could have the case heard in Massachusetts even though your spouse has moved away.
The types of contact that would allow you to bring your spouse to court in Massachusetts are defined broadly. They
are the following:
• maintaining a home in Massachusetts while involved in a relationship that gives rise to a family law case,
such as divorce or paternity;
• the commission of any act in Massachusetts that gives rise to such a case;
• having been previously involved with a case in Massachusetts that ordered child custody, support, alimony,
or property division when the later case involves the same people; and
• being served with the complaint in hand in Massachusetts.
The commission of any act that gives rise to such a case includes the act of conceiving a child. G.L. c. 223A, § 3;
Rosenfield v. Trombley, 38 Mass. App. Dec. 123 (1967).
Subject matter jurisdiction is the legal term for the second kind of limitation on the state’s power to hear a case. The
question is whether the subject of the case is one over which the state’s courts have the power to make decisions. In
family law, this question generally arises in custody cases. When children have been living in the state for a while,
that state’s courts can decide who should have custody, even if they do not have personal jurisdiction over both of
the parents. Most states have passed a law on this issue; the laws are fairly uniform across the country. Basically,
what the law says is that child custody cases are about the children and should be decided where they are, rather than
where the parents are. However, this may mean that the court that gives custody does not have the power to enter
orders against the absent parent, such as an order for child support.
Sometimes a state will find that its courts have subject matter jurisdiction over the marriage even if the state does not
have personal jurisdiction over both spouses. In Massachusetts, even if one spouse has never been to Massachusetts
and the courts cannot order that spouse to divide marital property or pay alimony, the other spouse can still obtain a
divorce. This will only make the spouses legally unmarried to one another; it will not decide other unresolved issues.
If you ask the court to decide those other issues, your spouse can always challenge this action, particularly if he or
she was not given actual notice that the case was going on or if he or she did not come to the court to argue the case.
Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 127 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
NO-FAULT DIVORCE
There are two kinds of no-fault divorce. The first is when both spouses come to an agreement and file a joint petition
for divorce together. The second is when one spouse files a complaint for divorce by himself or herself, stating that
the marriage has irretrievably broken down. Because the former is allowed under G.L. c. 208, § 1A and the latter
under G.L. c. 208, § 1B, they are often referred to by their section numbers. For example, your attorney might ask if
this is a “1A” divorce or a “1B” divorce.
The process is different for the two types of no-fault divorce. In a “1A” case, the parties file an agreement and joint
petition at the same time. Both spouses sign the joint petition and an affidavit of irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.
(An affidavit is a written, sworn statement.) It is understood that the spouses have worked out all the issues in advance
without the court’s assistance, including disclosure of all their financial matters to each other. The case can be heard
and a judgment entered right away. The divorce is not final until 120 days have passed from the date of judgment.
This is a quicker process overall than other ways to get a divorce. However, how soon the case is heard depends on
the backlog of cases in your county. See Exhibits 5A and 5B for examples of the joint petition and affidavit.
In a “1B” case—the most common type of divorce filed—one spouse files a complaint for divorce and states in it
that the marriage has irretrievably broken down. If the spouses cannot agree about the outcome of the case, or even
whether the marriage has broken down, the court will make those decisions for them through the divorce. The court
rarely decides that the marriage is not broken down when one spouse believes that it is. After filing for divorce, you
must wait six months to file a request for hearing. This six-month requirement may not make much difference,
because you will need time to prepare for the hearing anyway. After the hearing takes place and a judgment is
entered, the divorce is not final until ninety days have passed from the date of judgment.
At any time during a “1B” or a fault divorce, the spouses can come to an agreement and file a request that the case
be converted into a “1A” divorce. If this happens, the spouses must file the same paperwork that would have been
required to file a joint petition in the first place.
FAULT DIVORCE
For the most part, fault divorces are a relic of the past. Essentially, instead of saying the spouses are not able to live
together as husband and wife and they therefore need a divorce, one spouse is saying it is the behavior of the other
spouse that caused the marriage to end. In order to get a divorce on fault grounds, you must be able to prove that
your spouse has done what you allege. The fault must be one for which the statute allows you to get a divorce. The
grounds for a fault divorce are the following:
• Adultery. To prove this ground, you need to name the person with whom your spouse was unfaithful and
serve that person with a copy of the complaint.
• Impotence.
• Desertion. Your spouse must have deserted or left you for one continuous year prior to filing the complaint.
Your spouse cannot have come back to you even for a brief period during the period of desertion and must
not have made efforts to reconcile. Laflamme v. Laflamme, 210 Mass. 156 (1911); Miranda v. Miranda,
350 Mass. 478 (1966). In addition, your spouse must not have had a good reason for leaving and staying
away, such as leaving in search of employment. Kendrick v. Kendrick, 188 Mass. 550 (1905).
• Gross and confirmed habits of intoxication. This ground need not be daily substance abuse but does need to
be regular and severe bouts of intoxication. Jasper v. Jasper, 333 Mass. 223 (1955) (mere use of drugs not
ground for divorce but abuse must be shown).
• Cruel and abusive treatment. This ground does not have to be physical violence. The cruel and abusive
treatment needs to cause injury or harm to the victim’s health or to create a fear that the spouse may harm
the victim’s health. Mere words may wound the feelings to the degree that the health is impaired or
endangered. Brown v. Brown, 323 Mass. 332 (1948); Silverman v. Silverman, 5 Mass. App. Ct. 793 (1977).
• Refusal or neglect to support. To prove this ground, you need to show that your spouse was able to provide
support. In addition, the law states that the failure to pay should be wanton or gross and cruel. The cases
indicate that you need to show that you could not provide for yourself. Holt v. Holt, 117 Mass. 202 (1875).
128 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
• Incarceration. Your spouse needs to be sentenced for five years or longer or for life in prison or other
correctional facility. G.L. c. 208, § 2.
Clearly, it is easier to prove how long your spouse’s prison sentence is by bringing documents to court than to prove
confirmed and severe drunkenness. In general, proving infidelity is hardest. You need to name and serve the person
with whom your spouse was unfaithful. If the case finally goes to trial, the time it takes to prove fault will cost you
money and take an emotional toll on everyone involved in the case. Moreover, if you decide to pursue a fault divorce,
the court may not look upon you favorably. Your children may also be affected by any focus on blaming the other
spouse, however accurate your estimation of your spouse’s failings may be. Always remember that, unless you
receive the court’s permission, complaints for divorce and all other filings in the Probate and Family Court are
public record. Anyone, including your children when they are older, have access to your case file.
There is little advantage legally to obtaining a fault divorce. In deciding alimony and property division issues, the
court will weigh your spouse’s conduct whether or not you file a fault divorce. G.L. c. 208, § 34. Even in that
situation, the cases say that conduct should not be weighed as heavily as other factors. Filing successfully for a fault
divorce will not improve your chances of getting custody. In considering custody and visitation, the court will weigh
concerns about your spouse’s ability to provide a safe and loving environment for your children. All important
evidence about his or her character and parenting ability will be brought forward regardless of what grounds you
named in your complaint.
There are two theoretical advantages to a fault divorce. First, if a spouse has been a victim of domestic violence, the
judges generally understand that it can be important for that person to get a divorce for cruel and abusive treatment.
Second, you can request a hearing for divorce as soon as you like. Compare this to a no-fault divorce, where the
parties have not come to an agreement. These parties must wait six months to file a request for hearing. Realistically, if
you and your spouse have serious disagreements, it will probably take longer than six months to be ready for a
hearing. If you come to an agreement before six months pass, you can file a motion to convert the case to a “1A”
divorce and be heard much sooner.
WHERE TO FILE
Divorce cases are filed with the clerk’s office in the Probate and Family Court. If either spouse lives in the county
where the two of you last lived together, you must file in that county. If neither of you live there now, you may file
in the county where you or your spouse lives now. G.L. c. 208, § 6. In some counties, the court also allows for
electronic filing with the intention of moving to a more streamlined process. All forms are available through the
Probate and Family Court website at https://www.mass.gov/service-details/divorce-court-forms.
Each county has at least one Probate and Family Court session. Some have a central courthouse and hold satellite
sessions in other courthouses. For example, in Middlesex County, the central courthouse is located in Cambridge
and the satellite sessions are located in Concord, Lowell, and Marlborough. In most counties, you should file your
complaint in the central courthouse. Call ahead to ask the clerk’s office where and how to file. Then you may ask to
be heard in the satellite sessions.
COMPLAINT
The complaint is a one-page form that requires straightforward information. See Exhibit 5C for a sample complaint
form. It is important to complete this form accurately, particularly the section regarding other cases involving care
and custody of your children. You need to be clear about the dates and places of your marriage and separation
because these will determine whether the court has jurisdiction.
The last section of the form is a list of objectives that you can request from your divorce, such as custody, parenting
time, and support. The legal term for the things you want is “relief,” and the request for the things you want is the
“prayer for relief.” Ask for everything you may want, whether you want it in part or in whole. For example, if you
expect that your children will live with your spouse but you will be involved in making major decisions about them,
check the box asking for custody. You want legal custody, not physical custody, but you check off custody anyway.
The difference between legal and physical custody is discussed below.
Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 129 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
The box for freedom from restraint should only be checked if you want a restraining order against your spouse.
Years ago, a restraining order was an order that told one spouse not to bother the other. Now, the Probate and
Family Courts can only issue orders not to contact or abuse when it is necessary for the health, safety, or welfare of
one of the parties or their children. In these cases, the orders are entered into the central registry and violations are
criminal matters. G.L. c. 208, § 34C.
If you or spouse own any real estate, you must write the book and page numbers where the deed giving you, your
spouse, or both of you ownership of the house can be found. In the last and blank section of the form, you may wish
to write a request for division of marital debts and assets.
Although you should be complete and accurate, if you make a mistake, you can correct it by filing a motion to
amend the complaint. In general, this will be allowed without any difficulty.
ANSWER
If your spouse files and serves you with a complaint, the proper thing to do is file an answer. In many types of
lawsuits, the court will find against you automatically if you do not file an answer within a certain number of days.
This is called a default. In Massachusetts, you will not be in default for not filing an answer in a divorce. However,
it is considered good practice to file one.
See Exhibit 5D for a model answer. It follows a format that you will use for most of the papers you file with the
court. The heading indicates that the answer is filed in Massachusetts, in the Probate and Family Court, and in a
particular county. It further describes your case by showing the names of the parties and the docket number. You
and your spouse may have had other cases in the same county, but your divorce is known by a certain number. There
is a space at the top of the document to write a description of what document you are filing.
You should admit or deny each allegation set forth in the complaint. If you do not know how to answer an
allegation, say so. If you know the correct facts, state them in your answer. For example, if your address is wrong,
you might write “Deny. I live at 123 Main Street, Anytown, MA.”
DEFENSES
It may be that you do not wish to be divorced, even though your spouse does. In general, this will not matter. If one
person says the marriage is broken, it is considered broken under the law. However, you can defend against your
spouse’s complaint for divorce in other ways. You can say that any of the statements in the complaint are not
accurate. You can also say that if they are true, your spouse should still not be able to divorce you for fault or that
the relief he or she wants should not be ordered. For example, you can argue that the court does not have jurisdiction
over the case or that it is being heard in the wrong county.
Following are two defenses that are specific to fault divorces:
• Condonation. You cannot file for divorce based on fault if you forgave your spouse at the time and your
marriage went forward. You can get divorced for things that happened some time ago if you have lived
apart or otherwise not healed your marriage. However, you cannot go back in time to the fault that you
condoned.
• Insanity. If a spouse commits a breach of the marriage when insane, he or she is not held responsible for it.
COUNTERCLAIM
If your spouse files a complaint for divorce and you disagree with anything in it, you may wish to file a
counterclaim. This is your own complaint, in which you set out your facts and your prayer for relief. By filing a
counterclaim, you are asking for a divorce. See Exhibit 5D for a sample answer and counterclaim.
130 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
SEPARATION AGREEMENTS
Sooner or later, it is likely that you and your spouse will come to an agreement. Fewer than 10 percent of all cases
go to trial. The whole court process encourages settlement.
This is not without reason. Trials are costly and time consuming and increase hostility between spouses. In addition,
when you settle a case, you have more control over the outcome. With a trial, you are gambling that the judge will
see the case as you would like, rather than as your spouse would like.
In order to settle cases, there is significant pressure on the parties at certain points in the process. While you are swept
up in the heat of the moment, it is hard to see things clearly. If you are too rigid, you may lose the best chance to
resolve your case and move on with your life. On the other hand, if you just want the whole thing to end, you may give
in on subjects that you later regret. As a general rule, do not insist on things merely to hurt the other side. Think about
what you really need, what you want, and what you could live without. Think about what is best for your children.
Having a cool head and knowing what is important to you are enormous advantages in negotiating an agreement.
While you are in the negotiating process, take the time to read every word of any agreement offered to you. Do not
sign anything until you completely understand it. Most agreements written by lawyers include some standard
language, or boilerplate, that is not easily understood. Be sure you get an explanation of any technical language. It is
never all or nothing. Many agreements have sections scratched out or new provisions written by hand in the margins.
If you and your spouse can settle the issues between you, you should write everything out, formally and in detail.
Then you sign that document (also called executing it) in front of a notary public and have it approved by the court
at a hearing. At the hearing, the judge will ask you if you have read the agreement, if you think it is fair and
reasonable, and if you understand it. If you have any last-minute doubts, particularly if you do not have a lawyer, tell
the judge you are not sure. Separation agreements can be complicated. To make them easier to understand, a sample
agreement, with explanations in bold type, is included as Exhibit 5E.
RECOGNITION OF DIVORCES FROM OTHER STATES OR COUNTRIES
The general rule of law is that Massachusetts will recognize as valid a divorce adjudged in a foreign jurisdiction (both a
foreign country and another state) if the foreign court has jurisdiction over the cause of the case and over both parties.
However, Massachusetts will not recognize a foreign divorce as valid in two situations. The first situation is when a
husband or wife goes into another jurisdiction to obtain a divorce for a cause that occurred while the parties resided
in Massachusetts. G.L. c. 208, § 39. The second situation is when a husband or wife goes into another jurisdiction to
obtain a divorce for a cause that would not authorize a divorce under Massachusetts law. G.L. c. 208, § 39.
Divorces Adjudged in Foreign Countries
To determine whether a foreign country divorce decree is recognized in Massachusetts, the Massachusetts court
must look to see if the foreign decree offends Massachusetts public policy. For example, when a divorce is granted
in a foreign country where there is no requirement for residency and the proceedings are conducted in a foreign
language that the participants do not understand, Massachusetts would not recognize the decree. Furthermore, if the
grounds for divorce in the foreign country do not exist in Massachusetts, Massachusetts would not recognize the
decree because it is contrary to Massachusetts public policy.
The exception to the above rule is when both of the parties appear in the foreign country for the divorce proceeding.
In this situation, one of the parties cannot later argue that the judgment is invalid because of what is called the
doctrine of estoppel. Put simply, even though the proceedings in the foreign country may be contrary to Massachusetts
public policy, the parties are estopped, or forbidden, from later arguing that the judgment was invalid because they
both believed in good faith that the foreign country divorce decree was valid. Bushnell v. Bushnell, 393 Mass. 462
(1984); Poor v. Poor, 381 Mass. 392 (1980), as distinguished by Thompson v. Harris, 504 F. Supp. 653 (1980).
Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 131 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
Divorces Adjudged in Other (“Sister”) States
Massachusetts must accept a divorce decree of another state and give it full faith and credit if the sister state made a
finding that the petitioner was domiciled in that state. See Heron v. Heron, 428 Mass. 537 (1998) (citing Sherrer v.
Sherrer, 334 U.S. 343, 354, 68 S. Ct. 1087, 92 L. Ed. 1429 (1948)); Cavanagh v. Cavanagh, 396 Mass. 836, 839
(1986) (and cases cited).
THE HEARING
How Long Before the Hearing
The length of time before a hearing can be scheduled depends on both the complexity of each case and the court in
which you filed the case. If you have an agreement on all issues, you have an uncontested case and will not have to
wait as long for a hearing. Some courts will allow you to bring the agreement to the court and you can have the
hearing the same day you file the paperwork. Depending on the court, an uncontested hearing can take anywhere
from a few weeks to several months to schedule. Check with the court personnel, as they will have the most updated
information regarding the length of time for a hearing.
It is always best to resolve those issues that you can agree upon. The more issues you and the other party agree
upon, the less time you will wait for a hearing to be scheduled because the judge will only have to consider your
contested issues. The more complicated and contested a case, the longer you will have to wait for a hearing.
How to Mark a Case for a Hearing
Uncontested Hearing
If you and the other party are filing a joint petition for divorce under G.L. c. 208, § 1A, you should file all of your
papers together at the Probate and Family Court clerk’s office. Once the clerk reviews your documents and makes
sure you have all of your paperwork in order, the clerk will send you a date for your uncontested hearing.
If you have filed a divorce case under G.L. c. 208, § 1B (a “no-fault” divorce), you will likely receive a notice for a
case management conference within the first two or three months after filing your case. The purpose of a case
management conference is to schedule a discovery deadline and streamline the timeline of your case. Each court has
a different method by which they issue case management notices, so ask a clerk if you have any questions about the
next step in your case.
If you have filed a no-fault divorce and have not received any notices, the Probate and Family Court has a form to
request a hearing date. See Exhibit 2H. All of your discovery (request for production of documents, interrogatories,
and depositions) should be complete before asking for a hearing. Send a copy of your request to the other side. The
following documents must be on file:
• a divorce statistical form, which is available in the clerk’s office (included as Exhibit 5F);
• a certified copy of the marriage certificate, which is available from the town hall that issued the license;
• a military affidavit form if one of the parties is unavailable (included as Exhibit 5G);
• an affidavit disclosing care and custody proceedings (included as Exhibit 5H); and
• a parenting class certificate, which each party will receive after attending a parent education program; the
class, called “Understanding the Effect of Divorce on Children,” is a required class (see Exhibit 5I).
Pretrial Conference
Whether you have received a case management conference notice in the mail or have requested a hearing yourself,
the court will send you a notice in the mail to attend a pretrial conference. A sample notice is included as Exhibit 2I.
You are required to prepare a written report for the pretrial known as a pretrial memorandum. A sample
memorandum is included as Exhibit 5J. The notice from the court describes everything that should be in it. Failure
to give the court a written report often results in monetary sanctions. Each side must file a current financial
statement at the pretrial conference. Some courts require that the pretrial memorandum and financial statement be
filed with the court before the hearing date. Check with your court for its rules.
132 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
The purpose of the pretrial is to determine the contested issues and the possibility of settlement. Prior to the pretrial
conference, all parties and their attorneys must meet to discuss possible settlement. In cases where there is domestic
violence involved or one party lives far away, this may be accomplished by conference call in some counties, or by
requesting that the probation officer meet with each of the parties separately in an attempt to mediate any disputes.
At the pretrial conference, the judge will ask whether you have met. He or she will also ask for your written pretrial
memorandums and for an estimate of how long it will take to try the case (e.g., one hour, one day, several days). The
longer it will take to try the case, the longer you will have to wait for a hearing date. However, you need to give your
best estimate of how long the trial will take. If your estimate appears unusual, the judge will ask you how many
witnesses you plan to call and what the contested issues are, and then will determine the length of the trial based on
the court’s experience with similar cases.
In some courts, the judge might want you to present any evidentiary motions at the pretrial conference. Some courts
will have you present evidentiary motions at some other date before the hearing. Either way, the court will want to
rule on these motions before the trial can be started. Pretrial motions generally concern evidence such as medical or
psychological records. See chapter 2, Overview of the Probate and Family Court. Depending on what side you are
on, your motion might seek to submit records or prohibit the other side from using certain records.
Usually it will be several months after the pretrial conference before you have a trial date. In rare instances, the
judge will order you to trial right then and there. Be prepared with testimony, witnesses, and any documents you
intend to use as evidence at the pretrial conference. In addition to preparing you for a trial if an early date is
available, this preparation helps each side to see whether any type of settlement will be possible.
If the parties have reached a settlement, this may be presented at the pretrial conference, and a hearing will be held
that day. Be sure to have a written agreement signed and dated by both parties as well as any attorneys. This saves
everyone time and stops you from having to return to court merely to have the agreement approved.
What Questions Will the Judge Ask?
Even in an uncontested divorce case, the parties must answer questions to establish grounds for a divorce. If there
are no attorneys, the judge might ask the questions. If one of the parties has an attorney, that attorney will ask the
questions. The line of questioning follows the statements in your complaint. For example, you might be asked about
your name, address, date of marriage, children and their dates of birth, and so forth. There will be specific questions
regarding the grounds for divorce. If you have filed a divorce on fault grounds such as cruel and abusive treatment,
you must testify about the facts that support your claim. In a case where the grounds are irretrievable breakdown,
you merely need to testify that the marriage has irretrievably broken and there is no hope for reconciliation.
If there is an agreement, the judge will ask both parties if they have read it, if they had the opportunity to consult
with an attorney, and if they feel the agreement is fair and reasonable. The judge makes his or her own decision
about whether an agreement is fair and reasonable and might decide not to approve a provision that he or she finds
unreasonable. The judge will tell you what parts he or she is refusing to approve and often will give both parties an
opportunity to discuss the issue in the hall.
The following are some of the questions the judge will ask in divorce cases:
• Please state your name.
• Where do you reside?
• Are you married to _____?
• When and where were you married?
• When and where did you live together?
• Are there any children?
• What are their names and ages?
In a hearing on a joint petition (Section 1A), or in an uncontested case under Section 1B, the judge will most likely
ask the following questions:
• Do you believe your marriage is irretrievably broken?
• Is there no chance of reconciliation?
Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 133 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
• Have you entered into a separation agreement?
• (Showing you a copy of the agreement) Is this the agreement? And is this your signature?
• Did you sign this as your free act and deed?
• Did you have the opportunity to consult with a lawyer before signing it?
• Do you believe the agreement to be fair and reasonable?
Some judges will ask you to summarize the major points of the agreement or will ask about each major point
separately. You should summarize that you agree to a divorce on irretrievable breakdown, what happens with the
marital property, what happens with the custody and parenting time with the children, what child support and health
insurance is to be provided, whether there will be alimony, and any other provisions.
For fault grounds, there will be questions specific to the allegations. For example, if the allegations are cruel and
abusive treatment, the questioning might go like this:
• When did you and your spouse last live together?
• What happened on that date?
• What did you do?
• What did your spouse do?
• Did you ever obtain a restraining order? When? Why? Describe what happened on that date.
• Was your spouse ever abusive toward you on other occasions? When? What happened?
In the event that your case does not settle at the pretrial hearing, the court will schedule a trial date. You will receive
a trial notice and order, which will contain all of the specific dates and deadlines in connection with your final
hearing. Prior to trial, you and the opposing party must exchange exhibits and your lists of potential witnesses,
which is discussed in detail below.
Practice Note
In a contested case, be prepared to present testimony related to the contested issues. Be sure to have
witnesses and extra copies of exhibits available. Although an attorney would be helpful in presenting the
evidence, you have the right to represent yourself. It is a good idea to review a book on trial practice to
learn how to ask questions and present exhibits. There are public law libraries in several counties. See
chapter 20, Resources, of this book. The law librarian will usually help you find the appropriate books.
Using Witnesses at Trial
All witnesses must have firsthand knowledge about what they are testifying to. That is, they can only testify about a
conversation they had or something that they saw. A witness cannot testify to what someone else told them, as that
is considered hearsay. There are exceptions to the hearsay rule, such as if the person is a party to the proceeding or
statements made to a guardian ad litem. Generally, however, a person can only testify about things they personally
saw or said.
Usually you can only call witnesses that you listed in the pretrial memorandum, except to rebut a witness called by
the other party. You should name all people whom you might call as a witness, just to make sure. Listing someone
as a witness does not mean you have to call them if you change your mind later.
You may need to subpoena witnesses to make sure they come to testify on the day of trial. See Exhibit 2N. This
costs money, unless you qualify to waive the fees and costs and have brought a motion requesting that the
Commonwealth pay it. (The clerk’s office has a blank form and the income guidelines. See Exhibit 5K.) If a
witness is subpoenaed and does not show up for trial, the judge may hold that person in contempt, issue a “capias”
(i.e., a civil arrest warrant), or grant a continuance to compel that person’s attendance. If you do not subpoena a
witness and that person does not show up, the court will make you go on without that person. To subpoena a
witness, you need to fill out a subpoena form, have it notarized, and have a sheriff, constable, or other person over
the age of eighteen serve a copy on the witness. You must also include fees for one day’s hearing and mileage. See
chapter 2, Overview of the Probate and Family Court.
134 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
Before the hearing, outline questions for each of your witnesses and cross-examination questions for each of the
other side’s witnesses. While it is preferable to have an attorney for trial, you can obtain books at a law library that
outline questions for various kinds of cases, including expert witnesses. If you are going to represent yourself, it is a
good idea to spend some time reading these books. Judges must hold pro se litigants to the same rules as attorneys.
See chapter 2, Overview of the Probate and Family Court, for additional information.
Using Other Evidence at Trial
Every document or thing you want to introduce into evidence must be marked as an exhibit and requires a different
foundation requirement—that is, questions and information to establish an exhibit’s admission. Some documents,
such as marriage certificates and birth certificates, can be admitted because they are public records. However, you
must have a certified copy of public records for the court. Be sure to bring a photocopy of every document for
yourself and the opposing party. Generally, you are limited to introducing the exhibits listed in your pretrial
memorandum. Again, list everything you might consider using. If you change your mind later, you are not required
to submit a document into evidence.
As with witnesses, it is a good idea to obtain library books that outline the steps for introducing various types of
evidence. For example, photographs and videos require different foundations than hospital records. Depending on
what things you want to use as evidence, you need to follow the steps for introducing them.
Going to the Courthouse
Dress and Protocol
Court is very formal. You should dress in businesslike attire, or as if you are going to church. Shorts, tank tops, and
jeans are not recommended. You should arrive on time, so follow any notices you receive in the mail. When in the
courtroom, do not interrupt other people when they are speaking. Wait your turn, and if you need to speak, ask
“Your Honor, may I please say something?”
Who Is in the Courtroom?
When you first arrive, the judge will probably not be on the bench. There will be a person at the front of the room
known as an assistant judicial case manager. Check in with this person; he or she will make sure the paperwork and
file are in the courtroom and will direct you to be seated or to go to the Probation Office (also known as the Family
Service Office). Some Probate and Family Courts have a “call of the list,” where they call out each case and the
parties answer if they are present. Other courts post the names of all of the cases scheduled for that day in a list
outside the courtroom. Once you check in with the clerk, you may be referred to the Probation Office, or even
another courtroom. Each courtroom has at least one court officer; some have two. They sit at the sides of the
courtroom and often have the job of keeping order in the court by announcing the judge’s arrival and departure and
ensuring that people are quiet. The officers can remove disorderly people from the room.
Probation Officers
Many courts will send you to the Probation Office to present your case. If there are attorneys, the probation officer
will meet with them first and then with you and your spouse. If there are no attorneys, the probation officer (who is
also known as a family services officer) will meet with both of you. If there is a history of domestic violence, you
can ask the probation officer to meet with each of you separately. The probation officer will ask you background
information and attempt to mediate a settlement. If you come to an agreement, it can be written up and presented to
the judge. If you do not come to an agreement you will return to the courtroom to see the judge; each party will have
the opportunity to present their position and what they want. During your meeting with the probation officer, he or
she will take notes about your case. If your case does not settle and you have to return to the courtroom to argue
your case, the judge will receive and read the probation officer’s notes from your session. You have the right to hear
and/or read the notes taken by the probation officer. Keep in mind that nothing you say in front of the probation
officer is confidential.
Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 135 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
The Hearing
The clerk will call your case by name (for example, the “Smith case” or “Smith v. Smith”), and the judge will ask
everyone to introduce themselves. State your name clearly. The judge may start by summarizing what he or she
believes the purpose of the hearing is. You can add to or clarify the purpose of your being there. In a divorce trial,
the judge will ask who the witnesses are for each party. Witnesses must be sworn in. This is often done in the
beginning. The clerk asks everyone who is to give testimony in the matter before the court to stand and swear that
they will tell the truth. If you will testify, you must stand, raise your right hand, and agree to tell the truth.
The plaintiff begins by calling his or her witnesses to the stand. The plaintiff questions each witness. The defendant
is then allowed to cross-examine each witness. When the plaintiff has called the last witness, the defendant can
begin calling his or her witnesses. The defendant will question his or her witnesses, and the plaintiff will then be
allowed to cross-examine each person. At the end, you will be given five to ten minutes to make a closing argument
outlining your theory and position in the case. During the trial, each party may object to testimony and introduce or
object to the introduction of exhibits.
Remember to answer questions with a “yes” or “no” as the proceedings are audiorecorded and cannot record nods of
the head. Also, refer to the judge as “Your Honor,” “Judge” or “The Court.”
At the end of the trial, the judge may not want to announce his or her decision from the bench. The judge will “take
it under advisement” and you will receive the decision in the mail. Some judges will require that each party submit
proposed findings of fact, a proposed judgment, and conclusions of law to support his or her position.
Proving Your Case
Child Custody
General Laws c. 208, § 31 governs custody of children. The court must determine what is in the best interest of the
child and presumes that joint legal custody is best. The court will look at the misconduct of each parent to evaluate
what best serves the child’s happiness and welfare. A judge will want to know if a parent is unfit or has alcohol or
substance abuse problems, a criminal record, or other characteristics relating to ability to parent. Mental illness of a
parent is not a per se disqualification for custody. Angelone v. Angelone, 9 Mass. App. Ct. 728 (1980). Sexual
preference of a parent is not grounds to deny him or her custody. Doe v. Doe, 16 Mass. App. Ct. 499 (1983).
However, abuse of the child and even abuse of the other parent will be considered in making a custody
determination. Custody of Vaughn, 422 Mass. 590 (1996).
Child Support
Massachusetts has child support guidelines and the courts have a form for calculating these guidelines. G.L. c. 208,
§ 28. The court looks at the amount and sources for each parent’s income, and the needs of the children. A court can
deviate from the guidelines for good reason. For example, an increase in child support may be warranted if the child
has significant needs or one parent has access to substantial property. Or a reduction may be warranted if the payor
has to travel a long distance to visit with the child or contributes in other ways, such as paying the child’s private
school tuition. If one parent is deliberately keeping his or her income low, the court may attribute income to him or
her—that is, the court may find that the parent has the ability to earn more money but is refusing to do so. In those
cases, in order to calculate the child support order, the court will use the amount the parent can earn rather than the
amount that he or she is actually earning.
Alimony
Alimony can be awarded to either spouse. Primarily it is based on the ability of one party to pay and the needs of the
other party. Specific criteria are spelled out in G.L. c. 208, § 34, as well as other sections of this book.
Massachusetts passed the Alimony Reform Act, G.L. c. 208, §§ 48–55, in 2011. Under the new law, alimony is
generally calculated as 30 to 35 percent of the difference in gross income between the parties, but may also be based
upon the recipient’s need for support. The length of the marriage determines the duration of alimony payments.

 CHECKLIST 5.1
Divorce Checklist
PREPARING FOR DIVORCE
 Assets—Prepare a complete list of all items of value that you and your partner have. Note the ownership of
each item, how it was obtained, and statements about the value of the item. You could use purchase receipts or
insurance records for this purpose.
 Automobiles—Is the car titled to you? Do you share the car? How much is owed on the car? Can you afford to
make the remaining payments? Does the insurance cover you?
 Children—Are there any issues affecting the children that may cause your divorce or separation to be
untimely? Have you thought about the custodial arrangements and parenting-time plans that would be
acceptable to you? Do you have adequate room for the children in your new residence? Do you have
information concerning medical or dental insurance for the children?
 Counseling—Marriage counseling is an option to consider if you are uncertain about ending your marriage. See
chapter 20, Resources, at the end of this book for information about services near you.
 Finances—Separation can cause severe economic hardship, particularly if your partner is the primary wage
earner. Consider alternative sources of income such as TAFDC, increasing your hours of employment, moving
to less expensive housing, or other ways to cut your costs or to maximize your income. You may also be able to
file papers requesting temporary support from your partner when you file your divorce complaint.
 Health insurance—If your partner is the primary owner of your health insurance policy, you may want to find
out your right to coverage once you are divorced. Massachusetts laws require “state approved” plans to continue
coverage for former spouses under certain circumstances. However, this requirement does not apply to
companies that are self-insured or companies that fall under the jurisdiction of federal laws.
 Household income—Be familiar with the true costs of running your household. Review all bank statements,
credit card bills, and other financial documents, and make copies of them.
 Income tax documents—Review your recent tax returns, especially those you filed jointly. Obtain copies of
your returns for at least the last three years.
 Insurance policies—If you have any insurance policies, identify the purpose of the policies and the carrier.
 Liabilities—Prepare a complete list of all debts that you and your partner have. Identify each debt, the original
amount of the debt, when it was incurred, the reason for the debt, who has made the payments, the amount of
the payments, and the balance owed.
 Marital residence—Do not move without consulting an attorney if you are in the process of buying your home
or you and your partner share a subsidized apartment. You may have rights that need to be protected.
 Savings—Do you have any joint savings or checking accounts? If so, you may want to consider closing the
account or withdrawing your share of the money in those accounts. You may want to consult an attorney
regarding your rights to the money in those accounts.
Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 137 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
FILING FOR DIVORCE
 Decide if you are obtaining a divorce on the basis of an irretrievable breakdown (no-fault divorce) or one on
grounds, or both.
• If you are filing a no-fault divorce, consider which petition is best. A joint petition may be appropriate if
your partner agrees to a divorce and you are able to negotiate a settlement of all of the issues relating to the
children, spousal support, and property.
• If you choose to proceed on grounds, decide which grounds you have evidence to prove. Review “No-Fault
Divorce” and “Fault Divorce,” above.
• Remember, you may list both fault and no-fault grounds at the same time.
 Complete the appropriate complaint. Consider your claims. Do you want custody of your children? Do you
want to go by your birth or previous name again? Do you want support? Do you want a restraining order?
 Obtain a certified copy of your marriage certificate, which is available from the Department of Public Health
Office of Vital Statistics, and complete a statistical information form, which is available from the Probate and
Family Court.
 Prepare a motion to waive fees and the accompanying affidavit, or get a money order to pay the filing fees. File
a financial statement. See chapter 2, Overview of the Probate and Family Court.
 Decide whether you need to file any temporary or ex parte orders.
 Decide whether you are filing for divorce in the appropriate court. You should file in the court with jurisdiction
over the county where you and your partner last lived together, the county where your partner lives now, or the
county where either of you live now if you last lived together in another country.
 Refresh your knowledge about serving the complaint. Review “Complaint,” above.
BEYOND FILING
After the defendant answers your complaint, decide the following:
 Are there any counterclaims that you must answer?
 Are there any issues in contest—e.g., Is the defendant also asking for custody? Typical contested issues are
– custody (see chapter 9),
– child support (see chapter 8),
– paternity (see chapter 7), and
– alimony (see chapter 6).
 Do you have the information you need to defend your claims or to prove your case? Consider using
discovery to get the information you need. Determine how helpful and knowledgeable your witnesses are.
 Decide whether settlement is possible. See chapter 19, Dispute Resolution Options.
If the defendant does not answer your complaint, you may proceed as if your case is uncontested. However, you still
must be able to prove your case.
THE HEARING
When preparing for the hearing:
 Prepare a statement of the facts of your marriage. For example, when were you married, and to whom?
What happened that led to this action?
138 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
 State the relief you want. This relief could include
– child support, in which case you should complete the child support worksheet (Exhibit 8B) as well as a
financial statement (Exhibits 5L and 5M);
– alimony, in which case you should state your reasons for seeking it;
– a court order allowing you to return to a former name (if you want to go by another name);
– a permanent restraining order (if necessary); and
– custody and parenting time arrangements.

This part is the heading, which identifies the case by Docket or Civil Action Number (C.A. No.), the parties’
names, the court, and the county. The court is the Probate and Family Court, and the county is Middlesex.
This agreement is made between Sheila Jones of 1234 High Street, Melrose, Middlesex County, Massachusetts
and Stanley Jones of 5678 Cedar Street, Woburn, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. The parties were married in
Boston, Massachusetts on January 1, 1997. There are two children born of the marriage, namely Nancy Marie Jones,
born on January 1, 1999 and Mary Louisa Jones born on January 1, 2001. The couple separated on or about January
1, 2007. They last lived together at 1234 High Street, Melrose, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. Mrs. Jones filed a
Complaint for Divorce on June 1, 2017, alleging as grounds an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage.
This is the statement of the facts. It describes what the divorce is all about. It is not necessary, but it helps to
be sure that everyone understands some of the basic facts to be the same. Later on, no one can say that Nancy
was not a child of the marriage, or that the marriage actually took place in 1995.
The parties have both had the opportunity to consult with the separate and independent attorneys of their choice,
although Mr. Jones has chosen to proceed unrepresented. The parties enter into this agreement freely and
voluntarily, without any restraint or coercion. Each party makes this agreement in reliance on the representations of
the other party with regard to his or her financial position. This agreement resolves all issues raised by the
Complaint for Divorce, including custody and visitation of the minor children, division of liabilities and assets,
support for the children and alimony.
This section is here to describe what the process was in negotiating the separation agreement and what issues
are being resolved.
It is possible for one spouse to sue the other for personal injury. This may be important for victims of
domestic violence. Some separation agreements say that all issues between the parties back until the
beginning of time are settled in the divorce. This means that one spouse abused by the other gives up the right
to sue for personal injury. That is not something a judge could order at trial and should not be given up
without something of value in return. If you were a victim of domestic abuse, then you may wish to speak
with a lawyer experienced in such cases to get some idea of the value of the case you would be waiving.
Remember, strict time limits apply to personal injury cases. You may wish to speak to a lawyer sooner rather
than later. To protect the rights of a victim, this agreement is more limited in its scope.
___ Sheila Jones ___ Stanley Jones
Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 147 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
Each party hereby waives and releases any and all rights that he or she may now or hereafter acquire as spouse
under the present or future laws of any jurisdiction to make a claim for a share of the estate of the other or to act as
executor or administrator for the estate of the other. However, nothing in this paragraph is intended to or shall
constitute a waiver of any rights or claims he or she may have against the other’s estate to enforce this agreement or
to enforce a judgment of another court of competent jurisdiction. Nor shall this paragraph constitute a waiver by
either party of any testamentary provisions which the other may voluntarily make for him or her.
In general, one spouse automatically receives at least some of the estate of the other spouse when he or she
dies. Once you get divorced, you give up your rights to receive a share of your spouse’s estate. This paragraph
acknowledges this fact. However, this paragraph says that if the deceased spouse owed the other some money,
such as back child support, the surviving spouse could still sue for it. Again, this paragraph is not absolutely
necessary, but it does explain what you both understand that the situation would be regarding the parties’
estates. If a spouse dies prior to the passage of ninety days from the date the divorce was entered into the
court’s docketing system, then the divorce is dismissed. In many cases, this could mean that the other party
retains his or her rights as a spouse.
From this date forward, the parties shall continue to live separate and apart from one another for the rest of their
lives. Each shall be free from the interference, authority and control of the other as if they were unmarried.
This paragraph is found in some agreements and means only that once you are divorced, you live separately.
Oddly enough, many lawyers will write out the same obvious things routinely because it is what they have
always done. Many judges do not allow this language any longer, because it implies that a restraining order
will issue.
Each party indemnifies the other from and against any losses incurred by the other as a result of a breach of this
agreement, and from and against all attorney’s fees costs and expenses incurred in enforcing the provisions of the
within agreement, providing however, that it is within the power of the breaching party to perform.
This paragraph means that if one party fails to live up to the terms of the agreement, then she or he will have
to pay any costs required to enforce it. This paragraph states that if you have to hire an attorney to enforce
the agreement, the other side will have to pay the attorney fees and your other costs. If the other party cannot
perform, he or she will not have to pay the costs.
For example, if your former spouse is fired and has no income to pay child support, then, at least for a while,
it might not be in his or her “power to perform.” It is possible that no costs would be assessed. The payment
of costs is generally under the judge’s discretion, and not all judges will order costs. Therefore, it is important
not to rely on this provision too much.
The failure of either party to insist in any instance upon the strict performance of any provision of this
agreement shall not be construed as a waiver of such provision and same shall nonetheless continue in full force and
effect.
Even if you and your spouse generally do not follow the agreement, you are still bound by its terms and not
by your new ways of dealing with each other. Each of you can decide later to enforce the agreement strictly.
This agreement shall be construed and governed according to the laws of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
You and your former spouse may move to other states, but the terms of your agreement will still be viewed
through the laws of Massachusetts. Please refer to Chapter 16, Modifications, as well.
This agreement will become operative at the time a Probate and Family Court finds it fair and reasonable and shall
MERGE with the judgment of divorce.
___ Sheila Jones ___ Stanley Jones
148 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
There is a significant choice here between using the term “merger” or “survival.” When an agreement
“merges” with the judgment of divorce, then you or your spouse can ask that any of the terms be modified
upon a “significant change in circumstances.” You can enforce it only by going to the Probate and Family
Court and filing a contempt action. Your spouse can claim that he or she is not able to live up to the terms of
the agreement and the judge may not order him or her to comply with the agreement. On the other hand, it is
sometimes a good idea for you to have that defense available to you.
When an agreement “survives” the judgment of divorce, it is a separate contract that binds you just the way
any other contract does, such as a contract to pay your credit card bill or to buy a house. It can be enforced
by going to the Probate and Family Court or the Superior Court. The defense of inability to perform is not
available with this type of agreement. A surviving agreement cannot be modified easily. See Chapter 16 for
more information on modifying the agreement.
Issues relating to your children, such as support and custody, cannot survive.
Theoretically, if you sign a surviving agreement that becomes operative right away, you could be bound by it
immediately. However, later you are going to take it to a judge to have it made part of the court’s decision.
The judge reads it and decides if it is fair and reasonable. If it is not, then the judge will not approve it. You
do not want to be bound to an agreement that the judge does not find fair. For that reason, the sample
agreement does not take effect until the judge makes the finding of fairness.
Custody of Mary
Sheila Jones shall have sole physical custody of the minor child of the marriage, named above. The parties shall
share legal custody.
Chapter 9 describes more fully the meaning of custody arrangements. What you may wish to consider is
whether you want to include some provision that will describe more fully what you both mean by joint legal
custody.
The example above may not be suitable language for a case where the noncustodial parent is not involved in
the child’s life or may be difficult to locate.
If you are a survivor of domestic violence, you may not wish to share legal custody. In some cases, it may be
inevitable unless you go to trial and even then, you may have to appeal the judge’s decision. It is especially
important that you tailor the language to reflect your safety concerns and the well-being of your children. For
example:
Mr. Jones shall have no right of access to any records containing information concerning Mary, including medical,
school, counseling, personnel or any information or data held by another person or agency concerning her.
It may be that you and your spouse have a history of not being able to agree on subjects related to the
children. One spouse may be often unavailable to assist with decisions. Sometimes the following provision can
assist you.
The parties shall have shared legal custody and shall make every effort to resolve significant issues relating to the
children by agreement. If they are unable to agree, then Mrs. Jones shall make the final decision. Mr. Jones shall be
informed of such decision in a timely fashion and he may bring the matter before the Probate and Family Court.

Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018 149 CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE
Support and Maintenance
Child support is discussed in Chapter 8. Described below is at what time the child support obligation will end.
The end of this obligation is defined as the time when the child becomes emancipated. The statute sets forth
this definition, which could be changed according to the parties’ wishes. For example, you might wish to
balance payment of college costs against payment of child support for the child who is living in a dorm or
apartment at school.
Mr. Jones will be obligated to pay child support by wage assignment in the amount of $100 per week, according
to the Guidelines of the Massachusetts Probate and Family Court. He will pay such child support until the
emancipation of the minor children, which for each child will be on the occurrence of the first of the following
events:
1. 2. 3. 4. 5. The marriage of a child;
The death of a child;
The enlistment of a child in the military, on the date actual service in the military commences;
The attainment of the age of 18, providing the provisions of paragraphs 5 and 6, below, do not apply;
The attainment of the age 21, providing that the child resides primarily with the custodial parent and is
principally dependent upon the custodial parent and the provisions of paragraph 6, below, do not apply;
6. The attainment of the age of 23, providing that the child is engaged in education or training programs,
except for summer employment.
A child shall be considered to reside primarily with the custodial parent notwithstanding any temporary residence at
an educational, medical, camping or other facility. If a child is disabled at the time when she or he would otherwise
be emancipated, the issue may be raised before the Probate and Family Court to establish further order of
appropriate child support.
The parties agree to co-operate in application for financial assistance in higher education costs. Each party will
contribute to the children’s educational expenses according to his or her ability to do so. If no agreement can be
made between the parties, this issue can be brought forward for resolution by the Probate and Family Court.
It is important to make sure there is some statement about the parties’ obligation for payment of college costs.
Especially if your children are older and you think they will go to college, be sure to include this.
When both children are emancipated, Mrs. Jones may bring forward the issue of alimony to be resolved by the
Probate and Family Court, applying the factors set forth in G.L. c. 208, § 34.
In most cases involving parties with moderate incomes, it is very unlikely that one parent will be ordered to
pay both child support and alimony. With this statement, you keep the possibility of paying alimony open
after the child support is ended. Otherwise, you will have to show a substantial change in circumstances. The
other side may be understandably very reluctant to include this provision. It is an area for negotiation.
Health and Life Insurance
Mr. Jones shall provide health insurance for the children and Ms. Jones through his employment when possible.
The parties shall share equally the necessary uninsured medical, counseling, dental and orthodontic expenses for the
parties’ unemancipated children. Mr. Jones shall maintain life insurance through his employment, if available, for
the benefit of the children of the marriage until they are emancipated. Such insurance shall be payable to Ms. Jones
as custodian of the funds.
___ Sheila Jones ___ Stanley Jones
150 Family Law Advocacy for Low and Moderate Income Litigants, 3rd Edition 2018CHAPTER 5: DIVORCE 
Sometimes one party wants the insurance money to go to a trust and to have another person serve as trustee.
This is a cumbersome arrangement that requires that an actual trust document be drafted. It may limit the
custodial parent’s ability to spend the money on meeting the children’s daily needs. In instances where there
is a significant sum of money at stake, it may make sense to consider a trust.
Liabilities and Assets
The parties have divided the personal property in a temporary order entered on August 14, 2007. All tangible
personal property in the possession of Mr. Jones is his sole and separate property and all tangible personal property
in the possession of Ms. Jones is her sole and separate property. The parties have relied upon the information they
have supplied each other in the division of assets.
Sometimes there will be a list of assets to be divided in the future. Identify such property as specifically as
possible and be clear about the date and the manner of transfer. For example:
On January 1, 2008, at noon, Mr. Jones will remove from the marital home the following items:
Grandfather clock left to him by his mother,
Stainless steel pots received as a wedding gift, and
Bedroom set, including double bed, bureau, armoire and two night stands which were in the master bedroom at the
time of separation.
OR
The amount of Mr. Jones’ pension through the Gizmo Corporation which accrued during the marriage, from the date
of the wedding up to this day, will be divided equally between the parties. Counsel for Mr. Jones will draft a
Qualified Domestic Relations Order to effectuate this division, which will not be unreasonably delayed.
Division of pensions and certain other financial assets require special expertise. Be sure that these transfers
actually take place. It would be very awkward for Mrs. Jones to discover fifteen years from now that Mr.
Jones is collecting his pension and nothing was done to protect her rights.
Mr. Jones will be responsible for the MasterCard bill and Mrs. Jones will be responsible for the Visa bill.
This is another area for negotiation. It is important to be realistic about payment of debt. If you cannot afford
to make the payments, do not make an agreement to do so. A provision such as this one could preclude you
from eliminating your obligations through bankruptcy. If Mrs. Jones files for bankruptcy, including joint
debts she agreed to pay, then the company holding the debt will try to get it paid by Mr. Jones. Presumably,
Mr. Jones bargained away something in order to obtain Mrs. Jones’ agreement to assume responsibility for
the debt.
The parties agree that they will not hereafter make any purchases or contracts or incur any expenses in the name
or upon the credit of the other. Each will indemnify and save each other harmless from any and all liability, loss or
expense, including reasonable attorney’s fees arising from such purchase or contract made by him or her after the
date this judgment is entered. The parties warrant and represent that they will not hereafter use the other’s name for
the purposes of having credit extended to him or her. Both parties will bear the costs of their own attorneys for this
action.
This means that you cannot use your spouse’s credit, such as using a credit card in your spouse’s name. If you
do, then he or she can sue you and make you pay for attorney fees.

Notaries should check to make sure you are who you say you are. It would be very unhelpful if your spouse
could have someone else sign your name to a separation agreement. It is also a good idea to initial or sign
every page and every change that was scratched out or written in. That way, there is no confusion about which
version was the final one and exactly what you agreed to.
