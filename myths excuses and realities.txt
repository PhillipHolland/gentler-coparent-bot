Below is the extracted text from the provided document that is relevant to co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse. Since the document, sourced from *Why Does He Do That* by Lundy Bancroft, focuses primarily on the dynamics of abusive behavior rather than explicitly addressing co-parenting or post-separation cooperation, the selected excerpts are those that indirectly apply to these topics. They describe the abuser's controlling tendencies, entitlement, manipulation tactics, and the challenges of changing their behavior—factors that would significantly impact co-parenting and cooperation with a former spouse, especially in the context of a history of domestic violence.

### Extracted Text Relevant to Co-parenting and Cooperating with a Former Spouse

#### From PAGE1:
- **"Abuser's behavior is driven by their values of entitlement and privilege. They learn that they can ensure that their feelings and needs are always the focus in the relationship by using tactics of power and control."**
  - *Relevance:* This suggests that an abuser’s need to prioritize their own feelings and maintain control could persist in co-parenting, potentially undermining cooperative decision-making or respect for the other parent’s role.
  
- **"Battering is a choice. Just like they chose not to abuse their bosses, neighbors, pastor, friends, or other family members, they chose to abuse their partners because they get what they want when they do it."**
  - *Relevance:* This indicates that an abuser can selectively control their behavior, implying they might continue abusive or controlling actions toward a former spouse in private co-parenting interactions while appearing non-abusive to others, complicating cooperation.

- **"Abusive men often have a distorted view of themselves as victims. This serves the purpose of redirecting the focus from their behavior by blaming the victim."**
  - *Relevance:* In a co-parenting context, this victim mentality could lead an abuser to blame the former spouse for parenting challenges or use it to manipulate situations, such as custody disputes, hindering effective cooperation.

- **"While a man is on an abusive rampage, verbally or physically, his mind maintains awareness of some level of what would look bad, get him in trouble, or hurt himself or his valuables which demonstrates a large level of control."**
  - *Relevance:* This highlights that abusers retain control over their actions, suggesting they might strategically use this control in co-parenting to manipulate or intimidate the former spouse without crossing public or legal boundaries.

#### From PAGE2:
- **"Because he benefits from being the one in power and having control:**
  - He gets to have his way without compromise.
  - He gets to be the center of attention.
  - He has someone to blame for his problems.
  - He has someone to care for him & do all the work.
  - He is exempt from the rules that apply to his partner.
  - He gets public status of partner and/or fatherhood without sacrifice.
  - He is often in a better financial position"**
  - *Relevance:* These benefits illustrate motivations an abuser might carry into co-parenting, such as insisting on unilateral decisions, seeking attention through the children, blaming the other parent, or leveraging financial or social status to dominate, all of which obstruct cooperative parenting.

- **"Abusers who do participate in individual therapy typically get worse as they use therapy to:**
  - Develop new excuses for their behavior.
  - Develop more sophisticated arguments to prove that their partner is mentally unstable.
  - Develop more creative ways to make her feel responsible for their emotional distress."**
  - *Relevance:* This warns that an abuser might misuse therapy to refine manipulation tactics, potentially accusing the former spouse of instability in co-parenting disputes or shifting blame, making cooperation challenging.

- **"Domestic violence is a criminal act, not a marital problem. We do not recommend couples counseling because the behavior is solely the responsibility of the abusive person, only he alone is capable of changing it."**
  - *Relevance:* This implies that joint efforts like couples counseling—or by extension, cooperative co-parenting—may be inappropriate or unsafe unless the abuser’s behavior is addressed, emphasizing individual accountability over mutual solutions.

- **"Violent behavior must be addressed and stopped before couples counseling takes place."**
  - *Relevance:* This suggests a prerequisite for any cooperative effort, including co-parenting: the abuser’s violent tendencies must be resolved first, indicating that safe co-parenting may not be feasible without prior intervention.

- **"Perpetrator treatment is a 12 month program that promotes a change in belief system which supports the use of non-violence in intimate relationships, holds the abuser accountable for all abusive behaviors, confronts denial, minimization and victim blaming, and helps to develop non-violent, non-controlling relationship skills."**
  - *Relevance:* This outlines the necessary steps for an abuser to change, suggesting that successful co-parenting and cooperation with a former spouse may depend on the abuser completing such a program and adopting non-violent, non-controlling behaviors.

### Explanation
The document does not directly mention co-parenting or cooperation with a former spouse, as its focus is on explaining abuser behavior and debunking myths about domestic violence. However, the above excerpts are relevant because they describe traits and patterns—entitlement, control, manipulation, and resistance to change—that would likely persist after separation and affect co-parenting dynamics. For instance, an abuser’s need for control could lead to unilateral parenting decisions, while their tendency to blame the victim might complicate communication or escalate conflicts over the children’s welfare. The text also implies that without significant intervention (e.g., perpetrator treatment), cooperation with an abusive former spouse could be difficult, unsafe, or impossible, as their core beliefs and behaviors remain unchanged.

This extracted text provides critical context for understanding the challenges of co-parenting with an abuser, highlighting the importance of addressing abusive behavior before expecting collaborative parenting or cooperation to succeed.
