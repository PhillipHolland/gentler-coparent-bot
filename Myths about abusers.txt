Below is the extracted text from the document "Myths about Abusers" by Lundy Bancroft that is relevant to co-parenting and cooperating with a former spouse, particularly in the context of dealing with an abusive ex-partner. The content focuses on understanding the abuser's behavior, mindset, and the dynamics that may affect co-parenting situations. I have included all relevant sections in full, ensuring the information is comprehensive and directly applicable to the challenges of co-parenting with an abusive former spouse.

## Relevant Text for Co-Parenting and Cooperating with a Former Spouse

### Myth 2: His previous partner hurt him.
"A man who was genuinely mistreated in a relationship with a woman would not be using that experience to get away with hurting someone else. It is fine to commiserate with a man about his bad experience with a previous partner, but the instant he uses her as an excuse to mistreat you, stop believing anything he tells you about that relationship and instead recognize it as a sign that he has problems with relating to women. Whether he presents himself as the victim of an ex-partner, or of his parents, the abuser's aim is to play on your compassion, so that he can avoid dealing with his problem."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
In a co-parenting scenario, an abusive ex-spouse might claim that their behavior stems from being hurt by you or a previous partner. This myth warns against accepting such excuses, as they are often manipulative tactics to avoid accountability and maintain control, which can complicate cooperation and communication.

### Myth 3: He abuses those he loves most.
"Most abusive men have close relationships with people other than their partners. Do they abuse their other loved ones? Rarely. It isn't the love or deep affection that causes his behaviour problem."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
This suggests that an abuser can control their behavior and may not abuse everyone they love, such as children or other family members. However, it does not guarantee they won’t target the co-parent or use the children as tools in the co-parenting dynamic. This highlights the need for vigilance to protect both yourself and your children.

### Myth 5: He has a violent and aggressive personality.
"The great majority of abusive men are fairly calm and reasonable in most of their dealings that are unrelated to their partners. In fact, a professional or college educated man has roughly the same likelihood of abusing women as anyone else. Women who live with abusers know that abusers come in all styles and from all backgrounds. Sometimes the more educated an abuser, the more knots he knows how to tie in a woman's brain, the better he is at getting her to blame herself, and the slicker in his ability to persuade other people that she is crazy. The more socially powerful an abuser, the more powerful his abuse can be - and the more difficult it can be to escape."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
Abusers often maintain a calm and reasonable facade in public or with others, which can make it difficult for the co-parent to prove abuse or gain support. In co-parenting, this could mean the abuser manipulates perceptions (e.g., with courts, teachers, or family) to undermine the co-parent, making cooperation challenging and requiring careful documentation and legal safeguards.

---

### Myth 6: He loses control of himself.
"When a man is on an abusive rampage, verbally or physically, his mind typically maintains awareness of his actions. An abuser almost never does anything that he himself considers morally unacceptable. He may hide what he does because he thinks other people would disagree with it, but he feels justified inside. He typically has a reason that he considers good enough. In short, the abuser's problem lies above all in his belief that controlling or abusing his partner is justifiable."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
This myth indicates that abusers are intentional and aware, not out of control. In co-parenting, this could translate to calculated efforts to intimidate or control during interactions (e.g., custody exchanges), suggesting that safety measures and firm boundaries are necessary rather than expecting spontaneous improvement.

---

### Myth 7: He is too angry. He needs to learn anger-management skills.
"When people conclude that anger causes abuse, they are confusing cause and effect. Everybody gets angry. In fact, most people have at least had occasional periods when they are too angry, out of proportion to the actual event or beyond what is good for their health. But they don’t necessarily abuse their partners. A man is not abusive because he is angry, he is angry because he is abusive."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
Anger management alone won’t resolve abusiveness, as it’s rooted in the abuser’s beliefs, not just emotions. In co-parenting, this means that expecting calmer interactions through anger management may not work—focus should be on addressing the abusive mindset and ensuring safe communication channels (e.g., through mediators).

---

### Myth 9: He hates women. His mother or some other woman must have done something terrible to him.
"Most abusers don’t hate women. They often have close relationships with their mothers, sisters or female friends. A fair number are able to work successfully with a female boss and respect her authority, at least outwardly. Some men use the excuse that their behaviour is a response to being victimized by women, because they want to be able to make women responsible for men’s abuse. It is important to note that research has shown that men who have abusive mothers do not tend to develop especially negative attitudes toward females, but men who have abusive fathers do; the disrespect that abusive men show their female partners and their daughters is often absorbed by their sons."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
This is critical if children are involved, especially daughters who may face disrespect, or sons who might adopt similar attitudes. The abuser may not hate all women but could target the co-parent specifically, using blame as a tactic, which complicates cooperation and requires protecting the children’s well-being.

### Myth 10: He is afraid of intimacy and abandonment.
"Abusive men are often jealous and possessive, and their coercive and destructive behaviours can escalate when their partners attempt to break up with them. But many people, both male and female, are afraid of abandonment and may reel from panic, heartbreak or desperation when being left by a partner. If a person’s panicked reaction to being left could cause threats, stalking or murder, our entire society would be a war zone. But postseparation homicide of intimate partners are committed almost exclusively by men, and there is almost always a history of abuse before the breakup."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
Post-separation, an abuser’s fear of abandonment could heighten abusive behavior, such as during custody battles or when the co-parent asserts independence. This underscores the need for safety planning, as cooperation may become more dangerous during these times.

---

### Myth 11: He has low self-esteem.
"An abused woman tends to pour previous energy into supporting her abusive partner and massaging his ego, hoping against hope that if he is kept well stroked his next explosion might be averted. How well does this strategy work? Unfortunately, not very. You can’t manage an abuser except for brief periods. Praising him and boosting his self-opinion may buy you some time, but sooner or later he’ll jump back into chewing pieces out of you. When you try to improve an abuser’s feelings about himself, his problem actually tends to get worse. An abusive man expects catering and the more positive attention he receives, the more he demands. The self-esteem myth is rewarding for an abuser, because it gets his partner, his therapist and others to cater to him emotionally. Think for just a moment about how your partner’s degrading and bullying behaviour has hurt your self-esteem. Have you suddenly turned into a cruel and explosive person? If low self-esteem isn’t an excuse for you to become abusive, then it’s no excuse for him either."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
Trying to appease an abuser by boosting their ego won’t lead to better cooperation and may worsen their behavior. In co-parenting, this suggests avoiding attempts to “keep the peace” through flattery, instead focusing on structured, neutral communication to limit manipulation.

---

### Myth 13: He has poor skills in communication and conflict resolution.
"An abusive man is not unable to resolve conflicts nonabusively; he is unwilling to do so. Research studies conclude that abusers have normal abilities in conflict resolution, communication and assertiveness when they choose to use them. They typically get through tense situations at work without threatening anyone and they manage their stress when they spend Thanksgiving with their parents. But they don’t want to handle these kinds of issues nonabusively when it comes to their partners."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
This is highly relevant, as it shows abusers can communicate and resolve conflicts effectively but choose not to with their ex-partner. In co-parenting, expect deliberate conflict creation or refusal to cooperate, necessitating formal agreements or third-party involvement (e.g., mediators or courts).

---

### Myth 17: He abuses drugs or alcohol.
"Many men hide their abusiveness under the cover of alcoholism or drug addiction. However, alcohol cannot create an abuser and sobriety cannot cure one. The only way a man can overcome his abusiveness is by dealing with his abusiveness."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
Substance abuse might worsen interactions, but it’s not the cause of abusiveness. If an ex-spouse blames drugs or alcohol, this myth clarifies that sobriety alone won’t improve co-parenting—direct confrontation of the abusive behavior is required, and safety must remain a priority.

---

### Additional Relevant Points
- "Abusers thrive on creating confusion, including confusion about the abuse itself."
- "Abuse and respect are opposites. Abusers cannot change unless they overcome their core of disrespect toward their partners."
- "Abusers are far more conscious of what they are doing than they appear to be. However, even their less-conscious behaviours are driven by their core attitudes."

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
These points emphasize the intentionality and lack of respect driving abusive behavior, which can manifest as confusion tactics (e.g., gaslighting) or disrespect during co-parenting. This awareness helps in anticipating and countering manipulation, ensuring decisions prioritize safety and clarity.

### Red Flags for Unhealthy Relationships
The document references a list of red flags for unhealthy relationships, which can aid in identifying abusive patterns early in co-parenting:  
"Can a woman tell early in a relationship that a man may turn out to be abusive? Psychologist Lundy Bancroft thinks you can. He has developed a list of red flags which can be found at this site:  
[http://www.Ifcc.on.ca/Red_flags_for_unhealthy_relationships.pdf](http://www.Ifcc.on.ca/Red_flags_for_unhealthy_relationships.pdf)"

**Relevance to Co-Parenting:**  
These red flags can guide a co-parent in recognizing ongoing or emerging abusive behaviors post-separation, enabling proactive steps to protect themselves and their children.

## Summary of Key Insights for Co-Parenting
The extracted text provides a detailed look at how an abuser’s mindset and behavior impact co-parenting and cooperation with a former spouse:
- **Manipulation and Excuses:** Abusers may use past hurts, anger, or substance abuse as excuses, but these are tactics to avoid responsibility (Myths 2, 7, 17).
- **Control and Intentionality:** They are aware and deliberate, not out of control, and can choose when to behave well (Myths 5, 6, 13), complicating trust in co-parenting.
- **Escalation Risks:** Separation or boundary-setting can increase abusive behavior (Myth 10), requiring safety measures.
- **Ineffective Strategies:** Boosting their ego or expecting skill improvements (e.g., communication) won’t stop abuse (Myths 11, 13).
- **Impact on Children:** Disrespect may affect daughters, and sons may emulate it (Myth 9), necessitating protective actions.

For effective co-parenting with an abusive ex-spouse, this suggests relying on structured communication (e.g., email or apps), legal protections (e.g., custody agreements), and prioritizing safety over appeasement. The red flags resource can further assist in navigating these dynamics.
